<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In this volume are included all of the game-fishes
of the United States east of the Rocky
Mountains, except the salmons and trouts, and
the tarpon, jewfish, and other fishes of large size,
which are described in other volumes of this
series. As a matter of convenience I have
grouped the fishes in families, whenever possible,
but in their sequence I have been guided chiefly
by their importance as game-fishes, and not in
accordance with their natural order. The latter
feature, however, has been provided for in a
systematic list on a subsequent page.</p>

<p>In order not to burden the text with matter
that might not be of general interest, the technical
descriptions of the fishes of each group are
given in small type at the head of each chapter;
and that they may be readily understood by
the lay reader the following explanations seem
necessary.</p>

<p>The length of the head is from the point of
the snout to the hindmost point or margin of the
gill-cover. The length of the body is from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
point of the snout to the base of the caudal fin,
the fin itself not being included. The depth of
the body is from the highest point of the dorsal
line to the lowest point of the ventral line,
usually from the base of the first dorsal fin to
the base of the ventral fin. The expression
"head 5" means that the length of the head is
contained five times in the length of the body;
the expression "depth 5" means that the depth
of the body is contained five times in its length;
"eye 5" means that the diameter of the eye is
contained five times in the length of the head.
In describing the fins the spiny rays are denoted
by Roman numerals, and the soft rays by Arabic
numerals, and the fins themselves by initials;
thus "D. 9" means that the dorsal fin is single
and composed of nine soft rays; "D. IX, 10"
means that the single dorsal fin has nine spiny
rays and ten soft rays; when separated by a
hyphen, as "D. X-12," it means that there are
two dorsal fins, the first composed of ten spiny
rays and the second of twelve soft ones; "A. III,
11" means that the anal fin has three spines and
eleven soft rays. The expression "scales 7-65-18"
indicates that there are seven rows of scales between
the dorsal fin and the lateral line, sixty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
scales along the lateral line, and eighteen oblique
or horizontal rows between the lateral line and
the ventral line. The number of rays in the fins
and the number of scales along the lateral line,
as given, represent the average number, and are
subject to slight variation; thus in some localities
the number of rays in a fin may be found to vary
one or two, and the number of scales along the
lateral line may vary from one to five, more or
less, from the number given in the descriptions.</p>

<p>I have adhered strictly to the nomenclature of
the "Fishes of Middle and North America"
(Bulletin, U. S. National Museum, No. 47), by
Jordan and Evermann, and in the main I have
followed the descriptions as recorded in that
admirable work; but in many instances I have
depended on my own notes.</p>

<p>The suggestions as to angling and the tools
and tackle recommended may be confidently
relied on, as they are in conformity with my own
practice and are based on my personal experience,
covering a period of forty years, on many waters,
from Canada to the West Indies, and from the
Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains.</p>

opercle ending in two flat points, or in a black
flap; a single dorsal fin, composed of both spiny
and soft rays; anal fin also having both spines
and soft rays; the dorsal spines varying from 6
to 13 in the different species, with from 3 to 9
in the anal fin; sexes similar; coloration mostly
greenish.</p>

<h3>THE SMALL-MOUTH BLACK-BASS</h3>
<h4>(<i>Micropterus dolomieu)</i></h4>

<p>The generic name <i>Micropterus</i> was given to
the small-mouth black-bass by the French ichthyologist
Lacépéde, in 1802, who was the first
to describe it. The name <i>Micropterus</i>, which
means "small fin," was bestowed on account of
the mutilated condition of the dorsal fin of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the specimen, a few of the posterior rays
of the fin being detached and broken off,
giving the appearance of a short and separate
fin. The specimen was sent to Paris
from an unknown locality in America, and is
still preserved in the Museum of Natural History
at Paris, where I personally examined it.
It is a fine example, about a foot in length, and
is remarkably well preserved. As there was no
known genus to which the specimen with the
curious dorsal fin could be referred, Lacépéde
created the new genus <i>Micropterus</i>. He gave
it the specific name <i>dolomieu</i> as a compliment
to his friend M. Dolomieu, a French mineralogist,
for whom the mineral dolomite was also
named.</p>

<p>Originally, the small-mouth black-bass was
restricted to the Great Lake region, parts of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys, and along the upper
reaches of streams flowing from the Alleghany
Mountains in the Southern states. It has, however,
been introduced into all of the New England
and Middle states, and into many Western
states. It has a compressed, rather elliptical
body, the dorsal and ventral outlines being nearly
equal; it becomes deeper with age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>As its range, or distribution, is so great and
extensive, and the waters it inhabits are so different
in hue and character, the coloration of the
small-mouth bass varies from almost black to the
faintest tinge of green, in different sections of
the country. The coloration is so variable that
it differs even in fish in the same waters. It is
influenced mostly by the hue of the water, character
of the bottom, the presence or absence of
weeds about the haunts of the bass, and, moreover,
the changes in color may occur in a very
short time when subject to these various conditions.
The general color, however, is greenish
of various shades, always darker on the back, and
paling to white or whitish on the belly. When
markings are present, they form vertical patches
or bars, never horizontal. Three bronze streaks
extend from the eye across the cheeks. All
markings, however, may become obsolete with
age.</p>

<p>The natural food of both species is crawfish,
which might be inferred from the character of
their teeth and wide-opening mouth. There is
a popular belief that they are essentially and
habitually piscivorous; but this is an error; they
are not so black as they are painted. They feed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
on minute crustaceans and larval forms of insects
when young, and afterward on crawfish, minnows,
frogs, insects, etc., as do most fishes that have
teeth in the jaws. But the teeth of the black-bass
are villiform and closely packed, presenting
an even surface as uniform as the surface of a
tooth-brush. Such teeth are incapable of wounding,
and merely form a rough surface for holding
their prey securely. All truly piscivorous fishes
have fewer, but sharp, conical teeth, of unequal
length, like the yellow-perch, pike-perch, mascalonge,
and trout, or lancet-shaped teeth like the
bluefish.</p>

<p>The black-bass is far less destructive to fish
life than any of the fishes mentioned; on the
contrary, it suffers the most in a mixed community
of fishes, and is the first to disappear.
There are small lakes in Canada and Michigan
where the brook-trout and black-bass have coexisted
from time immemorial without jeopardy
to the trout. There are small lakes in Wisconsin
where black-bass and cisco, with other species,
have coexisted for all time; and while the cisco
is as numerous as ever, the black-bass has almost
disappeared. It does not follow, however, that
black-bass should be introduced in trout waters;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
far from it. Brook-trout are being exterminated
fast enough, owing to the changed natural conditions
of the streams and their surroundings,
without adding another contestant for the limited
supply of food in such waters.</p>

<p>Both species of black-bass have been introduced
into Germany, France, Russia, and the
Netherlands. In Germany, especially, they have
found a permanent home. It was my privilege
materially to assist Herr Max von dem Borne,
of Berneuchen, with such advice as enabled him
to start on a sure footing in his enterprise, and
with such subsequent success in its establishment
that he published several brochures on the black-bass
to meet the demand for information as to its
habits and merits as a game and food-fish. An
effort was made some years ago to introduce the
black-bass into English waters, but without success,
owing to a want of knowledge as to the
proper species to experiment with. The small-mouth
bass was placed in weedy ponds or small
lakes in which only the large-mouth bass would
live.</p>

<p>The small-mouth bass thrives only in comparatively
clear, cool, and rocky or gravelly streams,
and in lakes and ponds supplied by such streams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
or having cold bottom springs. In lakes of the
latter character, in northern sections, it coexists
with large-mouth bass in many instances. In
such cases, however, the small-mouth will be
found usually at the inlet, or about the springs,
and the large-mouth at the outlet or in sheltered,
grassy situations. In winter it undergoes a state
of partial or complete torpidity. In ponds that
have been drained in the winter season it has
been found snugly ensconced in the crevices of
rocks, beneath shelving banks, logs, roots, or
among masses of vegetation, undergoing its
winter sleep. In the spring, when the temperature
of the water rises above fifty degrees, the
small-mouth bass emerges from its winter quarters,
about which it lingers until the water becomes
still warmer, when it departs in search of
suitable locations for spawning. At this time,
owing to a semi-migratory instinct, it ascends
streams, and roams about in lakes or ponds, often
ascending inlet streams, or in some instances
descending outlet streams.</p>

<p>When favorable situations are found, the male
and female pair off and proceed to fulfil the
reproductive instinct. The spawning period
extends from May to July, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
section of the country it inhabits, and when the
temperature of the water is suitable. The nests
are formed on a bottom of gravel or coarse sand,
or on a flat rock in very rocky streams. The
male fish does the work of preparation by scouring
with fins and tail a space about twice his
length in diameter, forming a shallow, saucer-shaped
depression, in which the female deposits
her eggs, which are fertilized by the male, who
hovers near by. The eggs are heavy and adhesive,
being invested with a glutinous matter that
enables them to adhere to the pebbles on the
bottom. The number of eggs varies from two
thousand to twenty-five thousand, according to
the size and weight of the female. The nest
is carefully guarded by the parents until the eggs
hatch, the period of incubation being from one
to two weeks, according to the temperature of the
water. The resultant fry are then watched and
brooded by the male fish for several days or a
week, when they seek the shelter of weeds and
grasses in shallow water.</p>

<p>The young fry feed on minute crustaceans and
the larval forms of insects. When a month old
they are about an inch long, and continue to
grow, if food is plentiful, so that they reach a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
length of from three to six inches in the fall.
Thereafter they increase a pound a year under
the most favorable conditions, until the maximum
weight is attained, which is about five pounds.
In some instances, however, they have reached a
weight of seven or even ten pounds, where the
environment has been unusually favorable; notably
in Glen Lake, near Glens Falls, New York,
where a half-dozen or more have been taken
weighing from eight to ten pounds. One of ten
pounds was twenty-five and one-half inches long
and nineteen inches in girth.</p>

<p>As a game-fish the black-bass has come into
his inheritance. As the French say, he has arrived.
With the special tools and tackle now
furnished for his capture, he has proved my aphorism.
"Inch for inch, and pound for pound, he
is the gamest fish that swims." When I ventured
this opinion twenty-five years ago, there were no
special articles made for his capture except the
Kentucky reel and the McGinnis rod, twelve feet
long and fifteen ounces in weight. In awarding
the palm as a game-fish to the black-bass, I do so
advisedly, in the light of ample experience with
all other game-fishes, and without prejudice, for I
have an innate love and admiration for all, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the lovely trout of the mountain brook to the
giant tarpon of the sea.</p>

<p>In the application of so broad and sweeping an
assertion each and every attribute of a game-fish
must be well considered: his habitat; his aptitude
to rise to the fly; his struggle for freedom; his
manner of resistance; his weight as compared
with other game-fishes; and his excellence as a
food-fish, must be separately and collectively considered
and duly and impartially weighed. His
haunts are amid most charming and varied
scenes. Not in the silent and solemn solitudes
of the primeval forests, where animated Nature is
evidenced mainly in swarms of gnats, black-flies,
and mosquitoes; nor under the shadows of grand
and lofty mountains, guarded by serried ranks of
pines and firs, but whose sombre depths are void
of feathered songsters. However grand, sublime,
and impressive such scenes truly are, they do not
appeal profoundly to the angler. He must have
life, motion, sound. He courts Nature in her
more communicative moods, and in the haunts
of the black-bass his desires are realized. Wading
down the rippling stream, casting his flies
hither and yon, alert for the responsive tug, the
sunlight is filtered through overhanging trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
while the thrush, blackbird, and cardinal render
the air vocal with sweet sounds, and his rival,
the kingfisher, greets him with vibrant voice.
The summer breeze, laden with the scent of
woodland blossoms, whispers among the leaves,
the wild bee flits by on droning wing, the squirrel
barks defiantly, and the tinkle of the cow-bell
is mellowed in the distance. I know of such
streams in the mountain valleys of West Virginia,
amid the green rolling hills of Kentucky and
Tennessee, and in the hill country where Missouri
and Arkansas meet.</p>

<p>The aptitude of the black-bass to rise to the
artificial fly is not questioned by the twentieth-century
angler, though it was considered a matter
of doubt by many anglers during the last quarter
of the nineteenth. The doubt was mainly owing
to a lack of experience, for fly-fishing for black-bass
was successfully practised in Kentucky as
early, certainly, as 1845. I have before me a
click reel made in 1848 by the late Mr. J. L.
Sage, of Lexington, Kentucky, especially for flyfishing.
I have also seen his fly-rod made by
him about the same time, and used by him for
many years on the famous bass streams of that
state. And I might say, in passing, that black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>-bass
bait-fishing, as an art, originated in Kentucky
a century ago. George Snyder, of Paris.
Kentucky, when president of the Bourbon
County Angling Club, made the first multiplying
reel for casting the minnow, in 1810, and as early
as 1830 many such reels were used in that state.
The rods employed by those pioneers of black-bass
fishing were about ten feet long, weighing
but several ounces, cut from the small end of a
Mississippi cane, with the reel lashed to the butt.
They used the smallest Chinese "sea-grass" lines,
or home-made lines of three strands of black sewing-silk
twisted together. Those old disciples of
Walton would have been shocked, could they
have seen the heavy rods and coarse lines that
are still used in some sections, for their own
tackle was as light, if not so elegant, as any made
at the present day.</p>

<p>Another quality in a game-fish is measured by
his resistance when hooked and by his efforts to
escape. I think no fish of equal weight exhibits
so much finesse and stubborn resistance, under
such conditions, as the black-bass. Most fishes
when hooked attempt to escape by tugging and
pulling in one direction, or by boring toward the
bottom, and if not successful in breaking away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
soon give up the unequal contest. But the black-bass
exhibits, if not intelligence, something akin to
it, in his strategical man&oelig;uvres. Sometimes his
first effort is to bound into the air at once and
attempt to shake out the hook, as if he knew his
misfortune came from above. At other times he
dashes furiously, first in one direction, then in
another, pulling strongly meanwhile, then leaps
into the air several times in quick succession,
madly shaking himself with open jaws. I have
seen him fall on a slack line, and again by using
his tail as a lever and the water as a fulcrum,
throw himself over a taut line, evidently with the
intent to break it or tear out the hook. Another
clever ruse is to wind the line around a root or
rock, and still another is to embed himself in a
clump of water-weeds if permitted to do so. Or,
finding it useless to pull straight away, he reverses
his tactics and swims rapidly toward the
angler, shaking himself and working his jaws,
meanwhile, as if he knew that with a slack line
he would be more apt to disengage the hook.</p>

<p>I have never known a black-bass to sulk like
the salmon by lying motionless on the bottom.
He is never still unless he succeeds in reaching
a bed of weeds. He is wily and adroit, but at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
same time he is brave and valiant. He seems to
employ all the known tactics of other fishes, and
to add a few of his own in his gallant fight for
freedom.</p>

<p>As a food-fish there is, in my estimation, but
one fresh-water fish that is better, the whitefish
of the Great Lakes. Its flesh is white, firm, and
flaky, with a fine savor, and a juicy, succulent
quality that is lacking with most other fresh-water
fishes. About the spawning period, especially
in fish from weedy ponds, it is somewhat
musky or muddy in flavor, like other fishes in
similar situations; but by skinning the fish instead
of scaling it much of that unpleasant feature
is removed.</p>


<h3>BLACK-BASS TACKLE</h3>

<p>The first consideration for the fly-fisher is suitable
tools and tackle, and the most important
article of his outfit is the fly-rod. Fortunately,
at the present day, manufacturers turn out such
good work that one does not have to seek far to
obtain the best. And the best is one made of
split bamboo by a first-class maker. Such a rod
necessarily commands a good price, but it is the
cheapest in the end, for with proper care it will
last a lifetime. I have rods of this character that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I have used for thirty years that are still as good
as new. But the angler should eschew the
shoddy split-bamboo rods that are sold in the
department stores for a dollar. A wooden rod
at a moderate price is far better than a split-bamboo
rod at double its cost. Rods are now
made much better, of better material, and considerably
shorter and lighter than formerly, and
withal they are much better in balance and action.</p>

<p>If any evidence were needed to prove and
establish the superiority of the modern single-handed
fly-rod over the old-style rod, it is only
necessary to refer to the following facts: At the
tournament of the New York State Sportsman's
Association, in 1880, a cast of seventy feet won
the first prize for distance; and at that time the
longest on record was Seth Green's cast of
eighty-six feet. At a contest of the San Francisco
Fly-casting Club held on October 11, 1902, at
Stow Lake, Golden Gate Park, Mr. H. C. Golcher
made the remarkable and wonderful cast of one
hundred and forty feet, beating the previous record
cast of one hundred and thirty-four feet,
held jointly by Mr. Golcher and Mr. W. D.
Mansfield of the same club.</p>

<p>A suitable fly-rod for black-bass fishing may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
be from nine to ten and one-half feet in length,
and weigh from six and one-half to eight ounces,
according to the preferences of the angler and
the waters to be fished.</p>

<p>For an all-round rod for all-round work my
ideal is ten and a quarter feet long and weighing
seven ounces in split bamboo and eight ounces
in ash and lancewood, or ash and bethabara. It
should be made in three pieces, with a stiffish backbone,
constituting the lower third of its length,
and with most of the bend in the upper two-thirds.
A rod constructed on this principle will
afford just the requisite amount of resiliency for
casting, with sufficient pliancy and elasticity for
playing a fish, and embody all the power and
strength needed. The reel-seat should be simply
a shallow groove in the hand-piece, with reel-bands,
instead of the solid metal reel-seat, which
subserves no good purpose and is only added
weight; moreover, it is now put on the cheapest
rods as a trap to catch the unwary. All metal
mountings should be German silver or brass.
Nickel-plated mountings are cheap and nasty.</p>

<p>A light, single-action click reel of German silver
or aluminum of fifty or sixty yards' capacity
is the best. A plain crank handle is to be pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>ferred
to a balance handle, but in either case
there should be a projecting rim or safety band,
within which the handle revolves, in order to
prevent fouling of the line. My own preference
is for the English pattern, with a knobbed handle
affixed to the edge of a revolving disk on the
face of the reel. A multiplying reel with an
adjustable click may be utilized instead of a click
reel for fly-fishing.</p>

<p>The enamelled, braided silk line is the only one
suitable for casting the fly, and there is no better.
A level line will answer, but a tapered one is
better adapted for long casts. It may taper
toward one end or both ways from the centre,
the latter being preferable. From twenty-five to
thirty yards is sufficient for all emergencies. It
should be thoroughly dried every day it is used.
A convenient way is to wind it around the back
of a chair.</p>

<p>Leaders may be from three to six feet long,
accordingly as one or two flies are used in the
cast. It should be composed of single, clear,
round silkworm-gut fibre, tapering from the reel
line to the distal end. It should not be tested to
a greater weight than two pounds, as testing silkworm
gut weakens it very materially. It may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
stained or not, though there is no advantage in
coloring it; I prefer the natural hue. There
should be a loop at the small end, and one three
feet above it, for attaching the snells of flies.
Before using it, it must be soaked in water until
soft and pliable. Extra leaders may be carried
in a box between layers of damp felt, so as to be
ready for emergencies. The best and smallest
and most secure knot for tying the lengths of
gut together in making the leader is a simple
half-hitch, like tying a single knot in a piece of
string. When thoroughly soaked, the two ends
to be tied are lapped a couple of inches, and a
single knot, or half-hitch made in them, pulling
the knot tight, and cutting off the loose ends
closely.</p>

<p>Snells should be three or four inches long, of
good single gut, the shorter length for end fly.
If the flies are made with a loop at the head, the
snells for same should have a loop at each end
for attaching to both fly and leader. If flies are
made on eyed hooks, the snell should have but
one loop for the leader, and a free end for tying
to the eye of hook. The best knot for the purpose
is made by passing the end of snell through
the eye of hook, then around the shank just below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the eye, and then between the shank and snell
and draw tight, forming a jam knot. Where the
snell is tied to the fly, it should likewise have
a loop for attaching to the leader. It should also
be reinforced by a piece of gut an inch long at
the head of the fly to strengthen it and prevent
chafing. Snells, whether separate or tied to flies,
should be carried like leaders between layers of
damp felt.</p>

<p>Most flies made for black-bass fishing are too
large. The largest trout flies tied on hooks Nos.
4 to 6 are big enough. As just mentioned, they
are tied directly to the snell on tapered hooks,
or made with a small gut loop at the head of the
fly, which is much the best way. Since the introduction
of the eyed hook, or rather a revival of
it, for trout flies, they are now utilized for bass
flies also. As between the Pennell hook with
turned-down eye and the Hall hook with turned-up
eye, there is not much choice. Both patterns
are based on the old Limerick hook. I prefer
the Sproat or O'Shaughnessy to either, with gut
loop at the head of the fly.</p>

<p>If the black-bass is not color-blind, he seems to
have a penchant for brown, gray, black, and yellow,
as flies embodying these colors seem to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
more attractive to him than others. One can
judge in this matter, however, only from experience.
And even then the deduction of one angler
is often at variance with the inference of another.</p>

<p>The most successful bass flies, like salmon flies,
are not made in imitation of natural insects. This
is true also of some of the "general" trout flies
that have proved particularly pleasing to the
black-bass, as the professor, grizzly king, king
of the waters, Montreal, coachman, etc. True,
the black, gray, red, and yellow hackles, which are
supposed to be imitations of caterpillars, are very
useful on nearly all waters; but their resemblance
to any known larval forms is very slight.</p>

<p>There is a well-known rule in regard to the size
and color of flies to be used at particular states
and stages of the water, and in accordance with
the time and character of the day. It is to use
small and dark flies on bright days, with low and
clear water; and larger and brighter flies on dark
days with high or turbid water, and at dusk.
This rule is hoary with age. It has come down
to us through past centuries with the indorsement
of thousands of intelligent and observant anglers,
and should be respected accordingly. It is in
the main reliable and trustworthy. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
there will occur exceptions to prove the rule.
And some iconoclastic anglers at this late day, in
view of the exceptions, declare that it is entirely
valueless as a guide; but they offer nothing better.
It is true, nevertheless, and a safe rule to
follow.</p>


<h3>FLY-FISHING</h3>

<p>To be a successful fly-fisher for black-bass the
angler must know something of the habits of his
quarry, or at least of its haunts and favorite places
of resort. On streams these places are in the
eddies of rocks or large boulders, in the deeper
water above and below riffles, under shelving
banks and rocks, among the submerged roots of
trees on the bank, near weed patches, driftwood,
and logs, and in the vicinity of gravelly bars and
shoals. Except in cloudy weather the angler
may rest during the noon hours, as the most
favorable time is in the morning and late afternoon
until dusk. If wading, the angler should
fish down-stream, and when the shadows are long,
should endeavor to keep the sun in front. He
should move slowly and cautiously, making as
little noise as possible, casting to the sides and in
front over every likely spot. Casts of thirty or
forty feet are usually sufficient. The flies should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
be allowed to float down-stream, with tremulous
motions, sidewise, to imitate the struggles of a
drowning insect, and then permitted to sink several
inches or a foot at each cast.</p>

<p>Whipping the stream is sometimes quite successful
where the bass does not respond to ordinary
casting. This is done by casting in quick
succession and repeatedly over one spot, allowing
the flies merely to touch the water, until several
such casts are made, when they should be permitted
to sink, for a few seconds, as before. In
making up the cast, two flies should be selected
of different combinations of colors, as polka and
professor. If necessary, changes should be made
until two are selected that seem to meet the
fastidious fancy of the fish.</p>

<p>If a taut line is maintained, the bass usually
hooks himself, but the angler should strike quickly
upon feeling the slightest tug, or when seeing the
swirl of the fish. One cannot strike too quickly.
By striking is meant a simple turning of the
hand sidewise, with a perfectly tight line; this
is amply sufficient to set the hook. Should the
line be slack and lifeless at the moment, a more
vigorous movement is required, but even then it
is usually too late. When a bass is hooked, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
contest should be between rod and fish, rather
than between the reel and fish. It is the spring
of the rod that conquers him, not the giving and
taking of line. If the rod is held firmly, at an
angle of forty-five degrees, with the thumb on the
spool of the reel, there is no likelihood of a good
rod breaking. Line should be given grudgingly,
and the fish kept on the surface as much as possible.
When exhausted he should be drawn over
the landing-net and lifted out quickly, at the same
time releasing the thumb from the reel to relieve
the strain on the rod.</p>

<p>In fishing from the bank in deeper streams, or
from a boat on small lakes, whereby the fish is
better enabled to see the angler, longer casts are
necessary, or the angler must screen himself from
observation by trees or bushes on the bank. The
boat should be kept in the deeper water and the
casts made toward the shallows of bars, shoals,
and weed patches. The best time for boat fishing
on lakes or ponds is from near sundown until
dark.</p>


<h3>CASTING THE MINNOW</h3>

<p>The live minnow, shiner preferred, is by far the
best bait for the black-bass, as it is more easily
seen, and the best way of presenting it is by cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>ing
from the reel. For this purpose a rod eight
or nine feet long is much better than a shorter or
longer one. After a long series of experiments
with rods from six to twelve feet, I arrived at
the conclusion that the one now known as the
Henshall rod, eight and one-fourth feet long and
from seven to eight ounces in weight, fulfils all
the requirements of casting, hooking, and playing
a black-bass. It is light, strong, and of beautiful
proportions. In first-class split bamboo it may
be as light as six and one-half ounces, but should
not exceed seven and one-half ounces. In ash
and lancewood, or bethabara, from seven to eight
ounces is the correct weight.</p>

<p>A multiplying reel is indispensable. It may be
two-, three-, or four-ply, but the best work and the
most effective casting can only be done with the
most perfect reel. It should be as light as possible,
in a fifty or sixty-yard reel. German silver is
the best material, though brass is fully as serviceable,
and costs less. Some very good reels are
made of hard rubber and metal.</p>

<p>Only braided lines should be used, as twisted
ones kink too much in casting. Undressed silk,
of the smallest caliber, size H, is best. Braided
linen is stronger, but of larger caliber, and not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
suitable for good casting. Neither can effective
casting be done with oil-dressed or enamelled
lines.</p>

<p>Snelled hooks on single-gut snells, size No. 1 or
No. 2, Sproat preferred and O'Shaughnessy next,
are the best in any method of bait-fishing for black-bass.
There are several other styles of hooks
used, but, everything considered, those named are
the most faultless, and for shape, strength, and
general excellence cannot be excelled.</p>

<p>No leader is used, as the minnow must be reeled
up to within a foot or two of the tip of the rod in
casting. The snell of the hook is attached to the
reel-line by the smallest brass box-swivel, or it may
be tied directly to the line. The casts are made
from right or left and underhand, not overhead
as in casting the fly. Casts of 160 feet have been
made in this way. The chief factor in this style
of casting is the proper control of the reel by the
thumb&mdash;by a gentle but constant and uniform
pressure on the revolving spool, to prevent overrunning
of the line during the cast, and a stronger
pressure to stop the reel at the end of the cast.
The thumb must be thoroughly educated to this
work, and, once acquired, the rest is easy, as but
little muscular effort is required. The novice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
must begin with short casts and increase their
length as he becomes more proficient in the management
of the reel. Perfect casting from the
reel is more difficult than casting the fly, and more
artistic.</p>

<p>In wading a stream the casts are directed to
the same likely places mentioned under the head
of fly-fishing. The minnow is allowed to sink to
half the depth of the water and reeled in slowly,
which gives a lifelike motion to the bait when
hooked through the lips. If there is no response,
the next cast should be made to another spot, as a
bass, if inclined to take the lure at all, will usually
do so upon its first presentation.</p>

<p>In fly-fishing it is imperative to strike as soon
as the bass seizes the fly, otherwise he ejects it at
once, if not hooked by a taut line, for he is conscious
of the deception as soon as the fly is taken
into his mouth. With natural bait it is different.
The bass first seizes the minnow crosswise or tail
first, turns it in his mouth, and swallows it head
first. This takes a little time. Usually he holds
it in his mouth and bolts away from other fish, or
rushes toward a secure hiding-place&mdash;hence the
vigorous initial dash and taking of line. If stopped
before being hooked, he gives several tugs in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
quick succession, when he should be given line
slowly. The angler, with thumb on the spool of
the reel, can feel every motion of the fish. When
he pulls steadily and strongly and increases his
speed, the hook should be driven in by striking in
the opposite direction to his course, or upward.
A vigorous "yank" is not needed. With the
strained line a movement of the tip of the rod a
foot or two is sufficient with a sharp hook.</p>

<p>If fishing from a boat, where the angler is
more apt to be seen, it should be kept in deep
water and the casts made toward the haunts of
the bass in shallow water. Should the hooked
bass break water on a long line, the slight
straightening of the bent rod that ensues will
tend to keep it taut, and there is nothing more
to do. On a short line, however (the bend of
the rod being maintained), he should be followed
back to the water by a slight lowering of the tip,
but it should again be raised as soon as he
touches the water. The critical moment is when
he is apparently standing on his tail, shaking himself,
with wide-opened jaws. If he is given any
slack line at this time, the hook is likely to be
thrown out.</p>

<p>Lowering the tip to a leaping fish is a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
old rule when done understandingly. It has
been ridiculed by some anglers who do not seem
to have a clear conception of it. They claim
that by lowering the tip it gives sufficient slack
line to enable the fish to free himself. But if the
rod is bent, as it should be, the simple lowering
of the tip with a short line merely relieves it
somewhat from the weight of the fish; there is
no slack line, nor could there be unless the rod
is lowered until it is perfectly straight, which no
wide-awake angler would permit. As the fish is
in the air but a second or two, the careless
angler simply does nothing, which is, perhaps, the
best thing that could happen for him.</p>

<p>Trolling is practised from a moving boat along
the edges of weeds or rushes, or in the neighborhood
of gravelly shoals and bars or rocky
ledges. The bait may be a minnow or a very
small trolling-spoon; if the latter, it should have
but a single hook. The revolving spoon is
itself the lure, and any addition of a bunch of
feathers, a minnow, or a strip of pork-rind does
not add to its efficiency in the least, and moreover
savors of pot-fishing. A rod and reel should
always be used, as trolling with a hand-line is
very unsportsmanlike.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Still-fishing is practised from the bank or
from an anchored boat. If the bait is live
minnows, no float is necessary; but if crawfish,
helgramites, cut-bait, or worms are employed,
a very small float is useful to keep the bait off
the bottom. The boat should be anchored in
close proximity to the feeding-grounds of the
bass, and the angler should keep as still as possible.
Contrary to the popular opinion, fish hear
sounds, not only those made in the water, but
those in the air as well, otherwise they would not
be provided with so delicate an auditory apparatus;
because they do not always notice sounds
made in the air is no proof that they do not hear
them. The suggestions already made as to the
hooking and playing and landing the bass apply
to still-fishing as well. The minnow is best
hooked through both lips, but if they are very
small, they may be hooked just under the dorsal
fin.</p>


<h3>THE LARGE-MOUTH BLACK-BASS</h3>

<h4>(<i>Micropterus salmoides</i>)</h4>

<p>The large-mouth black-bass was also first described
by the French ichthyologist Lacépéde, in
1802, from a drawing and description sent to him
from South Carolina by M. Bosc, under the local<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
name of "trout-perch." Owing to the vernacular
name, he gave it the specific name of <i>salmoides</i>,
"salmon-like" or "trout-like." Thirty years before,
pressed skins of the large-mouth bass had
been sent to Linnæus by Dr. Garden from Charleston.
South Carolina, under the name of "freshwater
trout," but Linnæus failed to describe or
name it. The black-bass is called "trout" to this
day in the Southern states.</p>

<p>The large-mouth black-bass is very similar in
appearance to the small-mouth bass. It is not
quite so trimly built, being somewhat more
"stocky" and robust. Its mouth is larger, the
angle reaching behind the eye. It has larger
scales, and those on the cheeks are not much
smaller than those on the body, while in the
small-mouth bass the cheek scales are very small
compared with its body scales. The large-mouth
is more muscular, and has a broader and more
powerful tail.</p>

<p>Its distribution is perhaps wider than that of
any other game-fish, its range extending from
Canada to Florida and Mexico, and, through
transplantation, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
It has also been introduced into Germany.
France, Russia, and the Netherlands, where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
greatly esteemed both as a game-fish and food-fish.</p>

<p>The coloration of the large-mouth bass is often
of the same hue as the small-mouth bass, though
usually it is not so dark, being mostly bronze-green,
fading to white on the belly. When markings
are present, they tend to form longitudinal
streaks of aggregated spots, and not vertical ones,
as in the small-mouth.</p>

<p>Its habits of feeding, spawning, etc., are very
similar to those of the small-mouth. It prefers
stiller water, and is more at home in weedy
situations, and will thrive in quiet, mossy ponds
with muddy bottom where the small-mouth would
eventually become extinct; on the other hand,
the large-mouth can exist wherever it is possible
for the small-mouth to do so. It is better able
to withstand the vicissitudes of climate and temperature,
and has a wonderful adaptability that
enables it to become reconciled to its environment.
The feeding habits of the two black-basses
are much the same, though they differ as
to their haunts. The large-mouth favors weedy
rather than rocky places, and though its food is
also much the same, the large-mouth is perhaps
more partial to frogs and minnows, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
absence of crawfish, which, like the other species,
it prefers.</p>

<p>In the Northern states it hibernates, and
reaches a maximum weight of six or eight
pounds, while in the Gulf states, where it is active
the year round, it is taken weighing twenty
pounds or more. In Florida I have taken it on
the fly up to fourteen pounds, and up to twenty
pounds with natural bait. In waters where it
coexists with the small-mouth bass there is no
difference in their excellence as food-fish. I have
often eaten the large-mouth bass from the Clearwater
lakes of Utah and Washington, that, with
the single exception of the whitefish of Lake
Superior, were the best of all fresh-water fishes.
And I can truly say the same of those from some
of the large rivers of Florida, notably the St.
Lucie, St. Sebastian, and New rivers.</p>

<p>It prefers to spawn on gravel or sand, but if
such situations are lacking, it makes its nest on a
clay or mud bottom, or on the roots of water-plants;
or in ponds of very deep water without
shallow shores, it will spawn on the top of masses
of weeds, in order to get near enough to sunlight.
In other respects its breeding habits are similar
to its cousin the small-mouth, the time of incuba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>tion
and the guarding of the eggs and young
being about the same.</p>

<p>As to the much-mooted subject of the gameness
of the large-mouth bass I have no hesitation
in saying, from an experience of nearly forty
years, covering all sections of the country, that
where the two species coexist there is no difference
in their game qualities. The large-mouth is
fully the equal of the small-mouth where they are
exposed to the same conditions. Many anglers
profess to think otherwise, but their deductions
are drawn from a comparison of the two species
when subject to totally different environment;
for it is altogether a matter of environment and
not of physical structure or idiosyncrasy that influences
their game qualities. A small-mouth bass
in a clear, rocky stream, highly aerated as it must
be, is, as a matter of course, more active than a
large-mouth bass in a quiet, weedy pond.</p>

<p>With others the opinion is merely a matter of
prejudice or hearsay, a prejudice that is, indeed,
difficult to account for. It does not make the
small-mouth bass a gamer fish by disparaging
the large-mouth. As I have said elsewhere, if the
large-mouth bass is just as game as the small-mouth,
the angler is just that much better off.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
As prejudice and ignorance go hand in hand, we
are not surprised when we hear persons&mdash;I do
not style them anglers&mdash;call the small-mouth
the "true" black-bass, implying that the large-mouth
is not a black-bass, but is, as they often
say, the Oswego bass, which is, of course, absurd.
I am glad to add, however, that the prejudice
against the large-mouth bass is dying out among
observant anglers, who know that a trout in a
clear stream is more vigorous than one in a
weedy, mucky pond.</p>

<p>From my own experience I am prepared to say
that the large-mouth bass is more to be relied on
in rising to the fly than the small-mouth, which
fact should be taken into consideration when the
gameness of the two species is compared. The
remarks concerning fly-fishing for the small-mouth
bass are also applicable to the large-mouth, as
both are fished for in the same way, and with the
same tackle, except that the rod may be a little
heavier. For the large bass of the Gulf states the
rod should be fully eight ounces in weight, and the
flies a trifle larger, on hooks Nos. 2 to 6; otherwise
the tackle should be the same.</p>

<p>Minnow-casting for the large-mouth need not
differ from that described for the small-mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
bass. The tackle likewise may be the same,
though for the heavy bass of Florida the rod may
be eight, or even nine ounces, if preferred. Hooks
may also be employed of a larger size, say Nos. 1
to 1-0, or even 2-0, as larger minnows are used
for bait.</p>

<p>Some anglers of the Middle West have adopted
a very short rod of six feet or less for casting the
live frog or pork-rind overhead, in the same way
as casting a fly. This is a very primitive style of
bait-casting, being the same as practised by bucolic
boys and Southern negroes using a sapling
pole without a reel. The frog is reeled up to
within a few inches of the tip and propelled like a
wad of clay from a slender stick as we were wont
to do as boys. The frog is projected with great
accuracy, but not without a smack and splash on
the water. With such a rod most of the pleasure
of playing a bass to a finish is lost. Presumably
the end justifies the means, but this method does
not appeal to the artistic angler. If bait must be
used, a small minnow, lightly cast from a suitable
rod, is more in accordance with the eternal fitness
of things and the practice and traditions of
the gentle art. In very weedy ponds and lakes,
however, where there is not open water enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
to play a bass, and where it must be landed as
soon as possible, this rod and style of casting
answer a good purpose.</p>
<div class="image" id="illo_062">
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_062.jpg">OSWEGO (LARGE-MOUTH) BASS</a></p>
</div>

<p>Still-fishing is the same for either species of
black-bass, but as it is usually done from an
anchored boat on Northern lakes, where the large-mouth
bass is of greater size and weight than the
small-mouth bass, somewhat heavier tackle may
be used than recommended for the small-mouth.</p>

<p>Trolling with the live or dead minnow, or a
small spoon with a single hook, is a very successful
method on lakes, ponds, and broad, still rivers.
A greater length of line can be utilized in trolling,
whereby the fish is not so apt to see the angler.
More ground can also be covered than in any
other style of fishing. The boat should be propelled
slowly along the borders of rushes and
weed patches, over shoals and gravelly banks,
and near projecting points of the shore. Considerable
care should be exercised to move as noiselessly
as possible, avoiding splashing with the
oars or paddle, or making any undue noise with
the feet or otherwise in the boat, as such sounds
are conveyed a long distance in so dense a
medium as water. In trolling, the line may be
lengthened to fifty yards, if necessary, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
from twenty to thirty yards will usually be sufficient,
especially when a good breeze is blowing.</p>

<p>Bobbing for the large-mouth bass is much in
vogue in the Gulf states, but is more often practised
in Florida. The conventional "bob" is
formed by tying a strip of deer's tail, with or
without a piece of red flannel, around a triangle
of hooks, the hairs completely investing the hooks.
A single hook, however, answers fully as well or
better. The hook is of large size, Nos. 3-0 to 5-0.
The method of procedure is as follows: The boat
is propelled by a single-bladed paddle, the paddler
being seated in the stern. The boat is moved
silently and cautiously, skirting the edges of
water-lilies and bonnets, which grow thickly
along the margin of the channels. The angler is
seated in the bow with a very long cane rod, to
which is affixed a short line of a few feet, not to
exceed six. As the boat advances, the angler
dances the bob as far ahead as possible. It is
held a few inches or a foot above the water, into
which it is "bobbed" at short intervals. Sometimes
the bass leaps from the water to seize it.
When hooked, the fish is landed without any ceremony
and as soon as possible, keeping it meanwhile
on the surface, to prevent its taking to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
weeds. Bartram described bobbing as practised
in Florida, for black-bass, nearly a century and a
half ago.</p>

<p>Although bass fishing dates back to the middle
of the eighteenth century, when bobbing, skittering,
and still-fishing were common methods in the
extreme Southern states for the large-mouth bass,
and though the dawn of the nineteenth century
saw bait-fishing and fly-fishing for the small-mouth
bass in Kentucky, it is surprising how little
was known in the Northern and Eastern states
about the black-bass and bass fishing a century
after Bartram described bobbing for that game-fish
in the narrative of his travels. Even so late
as 1871, when the <i>Forest and Stream</i> was established,
very little appeared in its pages anent bass
fishing. Indeed, a few years later, a discussion
lasting a year or more appeared in its columns
from week to week, as to whether the black-bass
would rise to the fly. Previous to the publication
of the writer's "Book of the Black-bass" in 1881,
no work on angling gave any but the most meagre
account of black-bass or bass fishing. The
"American Angler's Guide," published in 1849
by John J. Brown, states that the black-bass has
rows of small teeth, two dorsal fins, and a swallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>tail.
In the same work the large-mouth bass of
the Southern states is classified under the head
of "brook trout," the author being misled apparently
by its Southern name of "trout," and goes
on to say that they "grow much larger than
Northern trout," and that they "are fished for
with the same arrangement of tackle as the
striped bass or salmon." A contributor to the
work, however, from Buffalo, New York, treats
briefly and vaguely of still-fishing with minnows
and crawfish. Brief notes also from Southern and
Western anglers give fair descriptions of the appearance
and habits of both species of black-bass.
Frank Forester (Henry W. Herbert) knew no
more of the black-bass than Mr. Brown, and
acknowledges that he never caught one. That
old Nestor of angling, Uncle Thad Norris, in his
"American Angler's Book," 1864, gives the descriptions
of Louis Agassiz and Dr. Holbrook
for the black-bass, and then relates his only experience
as follows, "I have taken this bass in
the vicinity of St. Louis, on a moonshiny night,
by skittering a light spoon over the surface of the
water, while standing on the shore." Genio C.
Scott in his "Fishing in American Waters,"
1869, has less to say, and evidently knew less of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the black-bass than any of the earlier writers.
He gives just three lines concerning black-bass
fishing, saying, "This fish is taken by casting
the artificial fly, or by trolling with the feathered
spoon, with a minnow impaled on a gang of hooks,
and forming spinning tackle." Of all the angling
authors prior to 1870, Robert B. Roosevelt is the
only one who knew anything about black-bass or
black-bass fishing, having fished for it in the
St. Lawrence basin. He says, "They will take
minnows, shiners, grasshoppers, frogs, worms, or
almost anything else that can be called a bait."
Also, "They may be captured by casting the fly
as for salmon or trout, and this is by far the most
sportsmanlike way, but the most destructive and
usually resorted to is trolling." The only personal
experience he gives of black-bass fishing,
unfortunately, is by trolling with large flies. In
his "Game Fish of the North," 1862, he devotes
five pages to the black-bass, but apparently does
not discriminate between the two species. In
"Superior Fishing," 1865, he devotes two pages
to the black-bass of Canada and the Great Lakes,
in a general way, but gives two instances of fishing
as follows, "Pedro soon hooked a splendid black-bass,
and landed him after a vigorous struggle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of half an hour; he weighed three pounds and
three-quarters, and was thoroughly game." And
again, "That evening was again devoted to the
black-bass, which took both the fly and spoon
greedily."</p>

<p>During the period covered by the authors
named, from 1849 to 1869, the anglers of the
South and Middle West were using light cane
rods, Kentucky reels, and the smallest sea-grass
lines for bait-fishing, and trout fly-rods and trout-tackle
for fly-fishing, rods and tackle as light, to
say the least, as those in use today.</p>

<p>In 1866 I removed to Oconomowoc, Wisconsin,
where there were thirty lakes within ten miles
abounding in black-bass of both species, with
pike, rock-bass, crappies, perch, etc. On my
home grounds was a large shallow pond fed
from Fowler Lake. Becoming much interested
in the black-bass, and finding but little information
available in the books of that day concerning
their habits, I determined to give some study
to the subject. Accordingly I cut a ditch from
the pond to the lake, with suitable screens, and
stocked it with black-bass of both species. During
their spawning period in the summer I
watched them faithfully and constantly from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
blind of bushes on the bank. This I did for
several years, turning the adult bass into the
lake when the fry were large enough to look out
for themselves, and turning the fry out also in the
fall.</p>

<p>I extended my observations of the bass during
their breeding season to the many lakes near by.
I found a difference of several weeks in the time
of their spawning in these lakes, owing to the
difference in temperature, caused by their varying
depth. The appearance of the bass also differed
slightly in the various lakes, so that it was
possible, from a close study of their variations in
color, size, and contour, to determine in what particular
lake any string of bass was taken.</p>

<p>About the same time, from 1868 to 1870, Mr.
Cyrus Mann and Mr. H. D. Dousman established
their trout hatchery and ponds not far from Oconomowoc,
and Colonel George Shears, of Beaver
Lake, a few miles away, also began hatching trout
on a smaller scale. These establishments presented
an opportunity to study the artificial propagation
of brook-trout, and I soon became familiar
with the <i>modus operandi</i>. This was before the
institution of the United States Fish Commission,
though the state of Wisconsin already had an able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and efficient Fish Commission, Mr. H. D. Dousman
being one of the commissioners. Colonel
Shears also experimented with black-bass culture,
and between us we reared many thousands to
the age of three months, before turning them
out. Near my pond was a shallow, marshy cove
to which the pike resorted in early spring to
spawn, giving me an opportunity to study their
breeding habits, also. There being so many lakes
and ponds in the vicinity, and their being so well
supplied with fishes of various kinds, my opportunities
for the observation of fish life were as
great as fortunate.</p>

<p>The differences of opinion among anglers, of
all men, pertaining to the practice of their art, has
become axiomatic. Some will differ even to the
estimation of a hair in the legs of an artificial fly,
while it is averred others will go so far as to
"divide a hair 'twixt south and southwest side,"
as Butler has it. But, seriously, there are several
moot points which I have endeavored to discuss
in the following piscatorial polemic.</p>

<p>Two friends went fishing. Both were famous
black-bass anglers, with the enthusiasm born of a
genuine love and an inherent appreciation of the
gentle art so common among Kentucky gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>men.
One was a fly-fisher, the other a bait-fisher.
Each was a devotee to his especial mode of angling,
though generously tolerant of the other's
method. They had fished together for years
when the dogwood and redbud blossomed in
the spring, and when the autumnal tints clothed
the hillsides with scarlet and gold.</p>

<p>They differed in their methods of fishing from
choice, or from some peculiar, personal idiosyncrasy,
for each was an adept with both bait and
fly. But this difference in their piscatorial practices,
like the diversity of nature, produced perfect
harmony instead of discord. Each extolled
the advantages and sportsmanship of his own
method, but always in a brotherly and kindly
manner; never dictatorial or opinionated in argument,
or vainglorious and boastful as to his
skill, for both were possessed of the generous
impulses of gentlemen and the kindly influences
of the gentle art. Moreover, they were innately
conscious of a common aim, and differed only as
to the ways and means of best attaining that end,
which, while dissimilar, were not inharmonious.</p>

<p>And so the Silver Doctor and the Golden
Shiner, as they dubbed each other, went trudging
along the bank of the merry stream together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
The Doctor, lightly equipped with only rod, fly-book,
and creel, sometimes relieved the Shiner
by toting his minnow bucket or minnow net.
They were fishing a rocky, gently flowing river,
characteristic of the Blue Grass section.</p>

<p>They stopped at a broad, lakelike expansion
of the stream, caused by a mill-dam, and, in a
quiet cove at the entrance of a clear brook.
Golden Shiner proceeded to fill his minnow
bucket with lively minnows, using for the purpose
an umbrella-like folding net. This he
attached to a long, stout pole, and, after baiting
it with crushed biscuit, lowered it into the water.
In a short time he had all the bait necessary&mdash;chubs,
shiners, and steelbacks.</p>

<p>"The golden shiner is the best of all," said he,
"especially for roily or milky water; but the chub
and steelback are stronger and livelier on the
hook, and for very clear water are good enough."</p>

<p>They then proceeded below the mill-dam,
where there was a strong riffle, with likely-looking
pools and eddies.</p>

<p>"The proper way to hook a minnow is through
the lips," continued Golden Shiner, "especially
for casting. One can give a more natural motion
to the minnow on drawing it through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
water. For still-fishing, hooking through the
tail or under the back fin will answer; but even
then I prefer my method, unless the minnow is
less than two inches in length." And he made a
long cast toward the eddy of a large boulder.</p>

<p>"For the same reason," acquiesced Silver Doctor,
"artificial flies are tied with the head next the
snell,"&mdash;industriously casting to right and left
over the riffle.</p>

<p>"But some flies are tied with the tail next to
the snell," ventured Shiner.</p>

<p>"That is true, but it is unnatural. I never
saw an insect swim tail first up-stream. Nature
is the best teacher, and one should endeavor to
follow her lead." Just then the Doctor snapped
off his point fly. Upon examination he found
that the snell was dry and brittle next to the
head of the fly, though he had previously soaked
it well in a glass of water. He discovered that a
drop of shellac varnish had encroached beyond
the head of the fly for perhaps the sixteenth of
an inch on the snell. This portion, being waterproof,
remained dry and brittle&mdash;a very common
fault with cheap flies.</p>

<p>"This fly," said the Doctor, "was given to me
for trial by Judge Hackle. He tied it himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
The broken end of the snell still shows a portion
of shellac coating."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that before," remarked
Shiner. "No doubt many flies are cracked off
from the same cause."</p>

<p>"Without a doubt, as you say. I know a lady,"
continued the Doctor, "who, as Walton says,
'has a fine hand,' and who superintends an extensive
artificial fly establishment&mdash;and who has
written the best book ever published on the subject
of artificial flies&mdash;who personally inspects
every fly turned out by her tyers. And, moreover,
she varnishes the head of every fly herself,
in order that not the least particle of shellac may
touch the snell. Such careful supervision and
honest work, to quote Walton again, 'like virtue,
bring their own reward,'" and the Doctor resumed
his casting with another fly.</p>

<p>"Well, Doctor, I sympathize with you; but
my snells are clear-quill and no varnish. I may
throw off a minnow once in a while by a very long
cast, but it is soon replaced, and costs nothing.
And, speaking of casting, I observed that you
made half a dozen casts to reach yonder rock but
sixty feet away, while I placed my minnow, by
a single cast, a hundred feet in the other dire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>ction.
Moreover, I reel my line toward me
through undisturbed water, while you whipped
the entire distance by several preliminary casts."</p>

<p>"That is necessarily true," answered the Doctor;
"but while you must recover all of your line
for a new cast, I can cast repeatedly with the
extreme length of my line in any direction; so I
think honors are easy on the question of casting."</p>

<p>"But," persisted Shiner, "with my quadruple
multiplying reel, it is only a matter of a few
seconds to prepare for a new cast. Then again.
I have better control of a hooked fish, and can
give and take line much faster than you with your
single-action click reel."</p>

<p>"While I grant your reel has a great advantage
in speed, I hold that a single-action click reel is
all-sufficient to play and land a hooked fish. Your
reel is intended particularly to make long initial
casts, and it is admirably adapted for that especial
purpose; but in playing a bass it has no advantage
over a click reel; in fact, I prefer the latter
for that purpose. Really, the engine of destruction
to the hooked fish is the rod. Its constant
strain and yielding resistance, even without a reel
of any kind, will soon place him <i>hors de combat</i>."</p>

<p>Golden Shiner was not slow to perceive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
force of the Doctor's arguments and held his
peace. In the meantime both anglers had succeeded
in killing some half-dozen bass, the largest
ones falling to the rod of the bait fisher, as
is usually the case. The sun was now climbing
toward the zenith, and the Doctor's flies seemed
to have lost their attractiveness for the wary bass,
while the Shiner, seeking deeper water, was still
successful in his efforts. The day, however, was
becoming uncomfortably warm.</p>

<p>"You will admit, Doctor, that you must cast
your flies early in the day or late in the afternoon
to insure much success, while I can fish during
the middle of the day in deeper water and still
have a measure of reward, which I consider quite
an advantage of bait over fly."</p>

<p>"Granted. Fish rise to the fly only in comparatively
shallow water, and are found in such
situations in bright weather only early and late
in the day. But I prefer to fish at just those
times. I do not care to fish during the middle
portion of the day in summer." And the Doctor
proceeded to reel in his final cast.</p>

<p>Just then his friend hooked the largest fish of
the morning's outing. It was an unusually gamy
bass, and leaped several times in rapid succession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
from the water, shaking itself violently each time.
But the Shiner was equal to "his tricks and his
manners," and soon had him in the landing-net.</p>

<p>"Doctor, why does a hooked bass break water
and shake his head? Is it through fear or rage?"</p>

<p>"It is to rid his jaws of the hook. He can
neither pick his teeth with a fin, nor remove a
foreign substance from his mouth with his tail.
His mouth is his prehensile organ. A horse, cow,
dog, or fowl will shake the head violently to rid
its mouth of an offending object. But a fish,
having no neck to speak of, can only shake his
head by shaking his body, and that only in a
lateral direction. As a bass cannot shake himself
energetically enough beneath the water to
dislodge the hook, owing to the resistance of the
denser medium, he naturally leaps into the air
for that purpose; and he always does so with
widely extended jaws, as you have seen time and
again this morning. He probably also fortifies
himself at the same time by taking in oxygen
from the air. He does so, at all events, willy-nilly."</p>

<p>"How high can a black-bass leap from the
water, do you think?"</p>

<p>"A foot or two at most, as you well know,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
replied the Doctor. "In rocky streams like this,
one has a good gauge for measuring the leap. I
never saw a bass leap as high as yonder boulder,
which is about three feet above the water; and as
you have taken several fish in its eddy, you might
have proved it by your own observation, as I did
myself."</p>

<p>"I distinctly remember, now," affirmed Shiner,
"that my last catch&mdash;the big fellow&mdash;leaped
several times very near that same rock, and he
did not go half as high."</p>

<p>The two friends then repaired to a cool spring
beneath a spreading beech, to enjoy a luncheon
and a quiet pipe,&mdash;well satisfied with their morning's
sport,&mdash;and to continue the <i>argumentum
ad hominem</i> anent fly and bait, with the usual
result that,</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"A man convinced against his will.</span>
<span class="i4">Is of the same opinion still."</span>
</div></div>


<h3>THE ROCK-BASS</h3>
<h4>(<i>Ambloplites rupestris</i>)</h4>

<p>In the same family with the black-bass are a
number of other sunfishes that will next be considered,
merely as a matter of sequence, and not
on account of their importance as game-fishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The rock-bass was first described by the French
naturalist, Rafinesque, in 1817, while travelling in
America. His specimens were from New York
and Vermont, which he named <i>rupestris</i>, "living
among rocks." In the Northern states it is generally
known as the rock-bass, but in Kentucky
and other states of the Middle West it is called
red-eye, goggle-eye, etc.</p>

<p>Its original habitat was from Canada and Lake
Champlain southward along the Mississippi Valley
to Louisiana and Texas, but its range has been
extended to many other states east and west by
transplantation.</p>

<p>In its general appearance it resembles somewhat
the black-bass, but it is a deeper fish and is
more compressed. Its dorsal and anal fins are
comparatively larger and stronger. It has a large
eye and a capacious mouth well filled with small
teeth, some on the roof of the mouth being rather
sharp.</p>

<p>The color is of various shades of olive-green,
with brassy or coppery reflection, more or less
mottled with black, forming broken and indistinct
lines along the sides. The iris of the eye is
scarlet, hence "red-eye"; there is a black spot on
the angle of the gill-cover and dark mottlings on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the soft dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. It prefers
clear streams and lakes, and congregates in small
schools about rocky situations, gravelly bars, about
mill-dams, and in the vicinity of weed patches
in ponds. It spawns in the spring and early summer,
making and guarding its nest like the black-bass,
and feeds on crawfish, small minnows, and
insect larvæ. In size it usually runs from a half-pound
to a pound in streams, though reaching
two pounds or more in lakes. It is a good pan-fish
for the table, and is well thought of in the
Mississippi Valley, though held in lighter esteem
in the St. Lawrence basin, where it coexists with
larger and better fishes.</p>

<p>The rock-bass is an attractive-looking fish, and
for its size is very pugnacious. It will take the
artificial fly, or natural or artificial bait. It bites
freely at small minnows, grubs, grasshoppers, cut-bait,
or angle-worms. It is capable of affording
considerable sport with light tackle, owing to its
large and strong fins, and its habit of curling its
sides in opposition to the strain of the rod.</p>

<p>With a light fly-rod of four or five ounces, and
corresponding tackle, and trout flies on hooks
Nos. 5 to 7, the rock-bass is not a mean adversary.
It rises to the various hackles, and to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
flies as coachman, brown drake, gray drake, and
stone fly, especially toward evening. The flies
must be allowed to sink with every cast after
fluttering them awhile on the surface. For bait-fishing
a trout bait-rod of the weight just mentioned,
with a reel of small caliber and the smallest
braided silk line, will be about right. Sproat
hooks Nos. 3 to 4 on light gut snells tied with
red silk are the best. Live minnows about two
inches long, carefully hooked through the lips,
are to be lightly cast and allowed to sink nearly
to the bottom and slowly reeled in again. Or if
a float is used, the minnow may be hooked just
under the dorsal fin. A small float is necessary
when white grubs, crawfish, cut-bait, or worms
are used as bait. On lakes it is readily taken by
trolling with a very small spoon, about the size
of a nickel, with a single Sproat or O'Shaughnessy
hook No. 1 attached.</p>

<p>A rod nine or ten feet long cut from the small
end of a native cane pole, weighing but a few
ounces, with a line of sea-grass or raw silk about
the length of the rod, will answer very well for
bait-fishing. This is the tackle mostly used by
boys in the Middle West, and it might be profitably
employed by boys of larger growth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>A dozen "red-eyes," gleaming with green and
gold, on the string of the boy angler, is something
to be proud of. He gazes with fond admiration
on the wide-open crimson eyes, which to him
seem more precious than rubies. He admires the
bristling fins, the gracefully sloping sides, the
gaping mouth and forked tail, with boyish enthusiasm
and appreciation. Although hot and tired,
and with many a scratch and bruise on hands
and feet, such trifles are lighter than air, and do
not admit of a moment's consideration. Seated
on a rock at the margin of the stream, with the
string of fish in the water, he feasts his eyes on
the finny beauties with the conscious pride of
well-earned success and the happy culmination
of his outing. In imagination the battles are all
fought over and over again. He knows just
where and under what condition and circumstance
each fish was caught, as, with bare toes,
he separates and indicates the individual on the
string. That largest one was hooked under the
dam beside the big rock. The next in size was
taken among the roots of the old sycamore at
the bend of the creek. Another and still another
from the deep hole under the rocky cliff. Oh, the
joyous days of youth and going a-fishing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
glad springtime of life! And then, having laved
his swollen feet in the cooling stream, he washes
the blood and scales from his hands, scrapes the
mud and slime from his well-worn clothes, shoulders
his lance of elm, and starts for home, bearing
his trophies with as proud a mien as a warrior of
old returning with the spoils of war.</p>


<h3>THE SACRAMENTO PERCH</h3>
<h4>(<i>Archoplites interruptus</i>)</h4>

<p>The Sacramento perch is closely allied in structure
to the rock-bass, and is the only perchlike
fish in fresh water west of the Rocky Mountains.
It was collected by the Pacific Railroad Survey and
described and named <i>interruptus</i> by Girard, in
1854, owing to the interrupted character of the
vertical markings. It inhabits the Sacramento
and Joaquin rivers in California, and is much
esteemed as a food-fish, but unfortunately it is
being rapidly exterminated by the carp and catfish
that are said to infest its spawning grounds.
In its conformation it is almost identical with the
rock-bass, but differs in having more teeth on
the tongue and more gill-rakers. In coloration,
however, it differs very much, being sometimes
uniformly blackish or brassy, but usually the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
black coloration is disposed in several vertical
bars or markings of an irregular shape. It has
a black spot on the angle of the gill-cover.</p>

<p>I have had no experience in angling for the
Sacramento perch, which is said to be taken with
the hook in large quantities for the market. I
have no doubt but the tackle recommended for
the rock-bass would be just as effective for this
fish, with similar baits.</p>


<h3>THE WARMOUTH PERCH</h3>
<h4>(<i>Chænobryttus gulosus</i>)</h4>

<p>The warmouth perch, also known as the black
sunfish in the North, was first described by the
French naturalists, Cuvier and Valenciennes, in
1829, from specimens from Lake Pontchartrain.
Louisiana. They named it <i>gulosus</i>, "large-mouthed,"
owing to its big mouth. There is a
slight variation between the Northern and Southern
forms. It abounds in all coastwise streams
from North Carolina to Florida and Texas, and
sparingly in Lake Michigan and the upper Mississippi
Valley. In its general shape and appearance
it is not unlike the rock-bass, though in the
radial formula of its fins and in its large mouth
it approaches nearer the black-bass than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
other species of the family. It has a large head
and deep body, almost as deep as long, and is
nearly symmetrical in outline. Its teeth are in
brushlike bands on the jaws, with patches on the
tongue. The Southern form has one or two less
soft rays in the dorsal and anal fins.</p>

<p>It is dark olive on the back, lighter on the
sides, with blotches of blue and coppery red, and
the belly brassy or yellowish. Iris red, ear-flap
black, bordered with pale red, with three dusky
red bars radiating from the eye across the cheeks.
Fins mottled with a darker color, and a black
blotch on the last rays of the soft portion of the
dorsal fin.</p>

<p>It is not so gregarious as the rock-bass, but
otherwise is similar in its habits, though not so
partial to rocky situations, rather loving deep
pools and quiet water. It feeds on minnows,
tadpoles, frogs, insects, and their larvæ. It
spawns in the spring. It is a good pan-fish, and
grows to eight or ten inches in length and a
weight of nearly a pound. For its size, it is the
gamest member of the family except the black-bass,
and is more like that fish than the others.
It is a favorite game-fish in the South, rising well
to the fly, and is a free biter at natural bait.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>In angling for the warmouth, the same rods
and tackle mentioned under the head of rock-bass
are well suited. In the Southern states a
light native cane rod, ten or twelve feet long, and
a line of the smallest caliber, sea-grass or twisted
silk, is the favorite style of tackle, with hooks
Nos. 2 to 3 tied on light gut, and a quill float
and split-shot sinker. The usual bait is the
black cricket, or the catalpa worm or caterpillar.
The white grub found in decayed stumps, and
other larvæ, crawfish and small minnows, are all
useful. Of these the minnow is the best. On
streams a small float is necessary to keep the
bait from the roots of overhanging trees. In
the stillness of Southern streams, under the moss-draped
trees, I have idled away many a dreamy
hour in the pleasure of fishing for the warmouth,
but at the same time fully alive to the weird surroundings.
Occasionally the splashing of a
hooked fish on the surface entices an alligator
from his lair in expectation of a fishy morsel.
The echoes are awakened time and again by the
pumping of the bittern, the hoarse cry of the
crane, or the hooting of an owl in the dark recesses
of the cypress swamp. The solitudes of
those waters are very fascinating to the lone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
fisher. The novelty of the situation appeals very
strongly to the angler-naturalist whose experiences
have been on the clear, sparkling, tumbling
streams of the North. There Nature is ever
bright and joyous; here she is quiet and sombre
and subdued. But the fishes know no north or
south or east or west,&mdash;always the same creatures
of interest and beauty, and ever responding
to the wiles of the angler.</p>

<p>I was once fishing on St. Francis River, in
Arkansas, where the warmouths were both large
and gamy. One day I went through the woods
and cane-brakes to the banks of Mud Lake, situated
in the midst of a cypress swamp. The lake
was much smaller than it had been formerly, as
was apparent from the wide margins of the
shores, which were of considerable extent between
the timber and the water. On this margin
was a group of four cypress trees that in size
exceeded any that I had ever seen, and I think
worthy of mention. They were from twenty to
twenty-five feet in diameter, or sixty to sixty-five
feet in circumference, three feet above the
ground. They were buttressed like the wall of
a mediæval stronghold. In comparing notes with
many naturalists and travellers, they have de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>clared
the size of those cypress trees to be both
unique and wonderful.</p>


<h3>THE BLUE SUNFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lepomis pallidus</i>)</h4>

<p>The blue sunfish was first described by Dr.
Mitchill from the waters of New York in 1815.
He named it <i>pallidus</i>, meaning "pale," as it was
more sober in hue than the other brilliantly
colored sunfishes. It is the largest of the sunfishes,
so-called, as the black-bass, warmouth,
and crappies are not popularly regarded as
"sunfishes."</p>

<p>The blue sunfish has a wider distribution than
any other member of its family except the black-bass.
Its range extends from the Great Lakes
through the Mississippi Valley to Texas, and
along the South Atlantic states to Florida. In
the Middle West it is known as blue gill and in
the South as blue bream and copper-nosed bream.
It has a medium-sized head and very deep body,
its depth varying from one-half its length to almost
as deep as long, in which case, barring head and
tail, it is almost round in outline. It is much
compressed. The ear-flap is quite black, without
the pale or red border usual in the other sunfishes.</p>

<div class="image" id="illo_090">
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_090.jpg">"THE SMALL-MOUTH BLACK-BASS"</a></p>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_090.jpg">THE LARGE-MOUTH BLACK-BASS" </a></p>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_090.jpg">"THE ROCK-BASS" </a></p>
</div>

<p>As might be inferred from its extensive range,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
its coloration varies greatly. In large and old
examples it is sometimes of a uniform slaty hue
with purplish reflections. In others it is olive-green
or bluish green, darker above, with the
breast and belly coppery red. Young specimens
are more brilliantly colored, with silvery reflections
and various chainlike markings. It thrives
alike in stream, pond, or lake, adapting itself to
almost any environment. It feeds on insects
and their larvæ, very small minnows, and other
small aquatic organisms. It spawns in the
spring and early summer, and its manner of
nesting and guarding its young is similar to
that of the other members of the family. It
grows to six or eight inches in length usually,
but often to a foot, especially in large waters.
It is quite a favorite game-fish in most localities,
and with such tackle as recommended for the
rock-bass it gives considerable sport, especially
in localities that are lacking in larger and better
game-fishes. It rises well to the fly, and will take
any of the baits recommended for the other sunfishes.</p>

<p>In those states of the Middle West, where the
brook-trout does not exist, the "blue gill" is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
greatly esteemed and much sought after, as it
furnishes the opportunity to employ light trout
tackle in its capture, and with such gear it
affords fine sport. I have taken the blue sunfish
in all waters from Wisconsin to Florida.
In the latter state many years ago I fished a
fresh-water lake on Point Pinellas, near St.
Petersburg, Florida, though there were but two
houses there at that time. I was using a very
light rod, and the fish were as large and round
as a breakfast plate, and moreover the gamest
and most beautiful in coloration of any blue gill
I had ever met. The characteristic blue was
replaced by a deep, intense, and brilliant purple,
shot with silvery and golden reflections. While
playing one on the surface, an osprey sat on a
dead pine watching with apparent concern and
eagerness. The fish made a stubborn resistance,
with much splashing. Then a strange thing
happened. The fish-hawk swooped down and
seized the fish and attempted to fly away with
it. Perhaps the hook became fast to his claw,
but at any rate he circled around and around
the pond, tethered to my line. It was the first,
last, and only time that I did the aerial act of
playing a bird on the wing. After a few seconds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of this exciting and novel sport the osprey broke
away, carrying both fish and hook.</p>


<h3>THE LONG-EARED SUNFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lepomis megalotis</i>)</h4>

<p>This species was first described by Rafinesque
in 1820 from streams in Kentucky. He named
it <i>megalotis</i>, meaning "large ear," owing to its
large and conspicuous ear-flap. It is one of the
handsomest sunfishes in its brilliant coloration,
and a great favorite with the youthful Waltonians
of the Mississippi Valley. It inhabits small
streams in Michigan and the Mississippi Valley,
and the Atlantic slope from South Carolina to
Florida and Mexico, and is very abundant in Kentucky,
where it is sometimes called "tobacco-box,"
owing to its "lid-like" opercle.</p>

<p>Its body is short and deep, with quite a hump
or arch anteriorly, making the profile of the face
quite steep in old specimens. The ear-flap is
very long and wide, blackish in color, with a
border usually of pale bluish or a reddish hue;
its back is blue, with chestnut or orange belly;
sides with red spots and bluish lines; iris of eye
red; lips blue. The soft rays of the dorsal fin
are blue, with orange between. Ventral and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
anal fins are dusky blue. The top of the head
and nape is dark. The coloration is very brilliant
and varies in different localities. Its habits of
feeding and spawning are similar to those of
the blue sunfish, though it usually inhabits smaller
streams; it grows to a length of from six to eight
inches, and is regarded as a good pan-fish by
many.</p>

<p>It is an eager biter at angle-worms, which is
the bait <i>par excellence</i> of juvenile anglers, who
greatly enjoy fishing for "sunnies." The only
tackle needed is a light cane rod, very fine line,
and small hooks, Nos. 6 or 8, split-shot sinker,
and, of course, a float, for no boy would care
to fish without a "bob" or "cork." Half of the
pleasure of the young angler is in watching
the float.</p>

<p>But the fly-fisher may also obtain sport to his
liking with a rod of a few ounces' weight and
midge flies on No. 10 hooks, for at the close of
the day the long-eared sunfish rises well. In
the absence of better fishing this is not to be
despised.</p>

<p>I once saw a boy fishing for "tobacco-boxes"
from a rock beneath a mill-dam on a Kentucky
stream. He hooked one of good size, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
his eagerness to secure it tumbled into the pool,
which was quite deep, much over his head.
After some little delay we got him out, almost
drowned, and in a very limp and exhausted condition.
When finally he was restored and capable
of speech he exclaimed, "I saved my tobacco-box,
anyhow!" During all the struggle he held
on to his rod, and still clutched it when "landed."
Whether he did so from the desperation with
which drowning men are said to cling to straws,
or from an inherent sporting instinct, deponent
sayeth not. A clergyman, who knew nothing
of fish, but who was attracted to the scene, said
to the dripping boy, "My lad, let this be a
solemn warning to you: throw away the tobacco-box
you have saved and give up chewing; it
may drown you yet."</p>


<h3>THE RED-BREAST SUNFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lepomis auritus</i>)</h4>

<p>This handsome sunfish was the first of its
family to receive the recognition of a naturalist,
being described by Linnæus in 1758. He named
it <i>auritus</i>, or "eared," from its conspicuous ear-flap.
His specimen was credited to Philadelphia,
and was, presumably, from some neighboring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
water. It is a fish of the Atlantic slope, with a
range extending from Maine to Florida, and is
also found in Louisiana. It is very abundant in
the South Atlantic states.</p>

<p>Its form is similar to the long-eared sunfish,
but with a more prominent snout and a depression
in front of the eye. Its ear-flap is as long
but not so broad; its color olive or bluish above;
sides bluish with reddish spots; breast and belly
orange or red; blue stripes on the front of the
head. The southern form has a dusky blotch on
the last rays of the dorsal fin, which is lacking in
those of northern waters.</p>

<p>Its habits are similar to those of the other sunfishes
proper, as to food, spawning, etc. It grows
to a length of from eight to ten inches. It is a
favorite food and game-fish in the South, where
it is known as red-breast bream and red-bellied
perch. The same remarks as to angling mentioned
under the head of warmouth perch will
apply to this fish as well.</p>

<p>My angling career really began with the capture
of "silversides" with a paste of bread crumbs,
but was inaugurated with taking this "sunny"
and the "punkin-seed" on the artificial fly. An
old English gamekeeper, in the employ of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
family as gardener and hostler, taught me to tie
a fly and cast it with a willow wand when but
five years of age. At the feet of that Gamaliel
in corduroy I imbibed a love of angling that has
constantly grown with the lapse of years. But
increased knowledge of fishes and a wider experience
in angling have not lessened my affection
for my first love&mdash;the "sunny." This acknowledgment
is due one of the humblest and least important,
but also one of the prettiest species of
the finny tribe.</p>


<h3>THE COMMON SUNFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Eupomotis gibbosus</i>)</h4>

<p>This is the pumpkin-seed or "sunny" of fragrant
memory. It is enshrined in the heart of
many an American angler as his first love, when
with pin hook, thread line, and willow wand he
essayed its capture in the nearest brook or mill-pond.</p>

<p>Looking backward over an angling career of
half a century, the gamesome "sunny" with its
coat of many colors shines out as a bright particular
star among those of greater magnitude.
It is here set down, then, mainly as a matter of
sentiment and to keep its memory green.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The little "sunny" was christened by the
greatest naturalist that ever lived, Linnæus, who
in 1758 named it "<i>gibbosus</i>" owing to the gibbous
outline of its little body. His specimens
were from South Carolina.</p>

<p>It inhabits the Great Lake region, and the
Atlantic seaboard from Maine to Florida, and
the northern portion of the Mississippi Valley.
In outline it is not unlike a pumpkin-seed, hence
one of its popular names. This is well expressed
in its specific name <i>gibbosus</i>. It has quite a
small mouth, but large eye. In coloration it
rivals the gayly-tinted fishes of the coral reefs
in tropical seas. The predominating colors are
yellow and blue, being bluish on the back, paling
on the sides to a lighter shade, with yellow
blotches and coppery reflections, and belly bright
orange-yellow; the cheeks are yellow with blue
streaks; rays of dorsal fin blue, the connecting
membrane yellow; ear-flap black, ending in a
scarlet border; lips blue; iris of eye scarlet.</p>

<p>Its habits of spawning, nest-making, and care of
eggs and fry are similar to those of the other sunfishes
mentioned. It is partial to clear water, with
sandy or gravelly bottom, in the vicinity of weed
patches. It feeds on insects and their larvæ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
minute crustaceans, and is especially fond of the
eggs and fry of other species. It grows to a size
of eight inches, though usually from three to six
inches.</p>

<p>Like all the sunfishes, it is an eager biter, and
with very light tackle much real pleasure can be
enjoyed by the angler who is not too particular
as to his preferences. It rises readily to small
dark flies, as the several hackles, black gnat, etc.,
on hooks Nos. 10 to 12. For bait-fishing
nothing is quite so good as earthworms on
hooks Nos. 8 to 10.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of other sunfishes
belonging to this family, but those named are
the most important. In the Southern states,
where the sunfishes are known generically as
"bream" or "brim" and "perch," they are more
appreciated than in the Northern states, where
the brook-trout is the favorite among the smaller
species. If fished for with very light and suitable
tackle, there is a great measure of enjoyment to
be derived from bream-fishing, north or south.
Certainly for beauty of coloration they are not
excelled, and as pan-fish they are preferred by
many to the dainty brook-trout.</p>

<p>There is a certain fascination in fishing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
a float, or "cork," or "bob," as the boys have it.
And among us "old boys" there is a certain
undefined feeling, it may be a reminiscent affection,
connected with the float, much the same as
that with which we regard the powder-flask and
shot-pouch of the days of yore. And I am not
sure but that the old things and old ways were
best, or at least more enjoyable. One can heartily
agree with Alonzo of Aragon in his preferences
for old wood to burn, old wine to drink, old
friends to trust, and old authors to read.</p>

<p>What old angler does not remember the eagerness
and expectancy with which he watched the
"cork" in days gone by? How well he knew and
understood every motion of it, responsive to the
nibbling "sunny": first a gentle spinning, then
a preliminary bobble, then a premonitory start
away an inch or two, and then&mdash;O joy!&mdash;its
swift and sudden disappearance beneath the surface.
The lapse of time cannot wither nor
modern custom stale the pleasures of youthful
fishing. To be sure, it was not all piscatorial
cakes and ale; there were a few thorns with the
roses; there were the bruised fingers and toes,
the wet and torn clothes, and the impending
and dreaded "dressing down" when home was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
reached; but these disagreeable concomitants
were soon forgotten, and are now scarcely remembered,
while the pleasures are laid up in the
lavender of sweet recollection.</p>

<p>The old-time zest of fishing with a float can
still be gratified; we can renew our youth by
fishing for "sunnies" in the old-fashioned way.
In the wooded streams of the Southern states the
float is a <i>sine qua non</i> for bream-fishing, owing
to the many tangled roots of trees on the banks,
and the mosses, grasses, and other aquatic plants
that grow so luxuriantly in the sluggish waters.
Then here's to the float and the sunny and the
bream!</p>


<h3>THE CALICO-BASS</h3>

<h4>(<i>Pomoxis sparoides)</i>)</h4>

<p>The calico-bass was first described by Lacépéde
from specimens sent to France from South Carolina.
He named it <i>sparoides</i> from a fancied
resemblance, either in its scales or compressed
body, to those features in fishes belonging to the
family <i>Sparidæ</i>.</p>

<p>Owing to its wide distribution it has received
many names, more or less descriptive. In the
Northern states it is variously called crappie,
croppie, strawberry-bass, grass-bass, bank lick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
bass, silver-bass, big-fin bass, Lake Erie bass,
razor back, bitter-head, lamplighter, etc., while
in the Southern states it is known as speckled
perch, goggle-eyed perch, chincapin perch, bridge
perch, etc.</p>

<p>As the calico-bass and the next fish to be
described, the crappie, belong to the same genus
of the sunfish family, and resemble each other
very much, the vernacular nomenclature is much
confused, and in some instances is interchangeable.
Some years ago I proposed to call them northern
and southern crappie; but as the name calico-bass
has obtained considerable currency, it is best to
adopt that name for the northern species, leaving
the name crappie for the southern form.</p>

<p>The calico-bass is found in the Great Lake
region and the upper Mississippi Valley, and
along the Atlantic slope from New Jersey to
Florida and Texas. Its range has been considerably
extended by transplantation, even to
France, where it thrives well as a pond fish. It
is a handsome fish, resembling in its general
features and shape the sunfishes, but with a
thinner body and larger fins. It has a long head
and a large mouth, with thin lips and projecting
lower jaw. The eye is large with a dark, bluish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
iris. Its fins are large and strong. It grows
usually to eight or ten inches in length, weighing
from half a pound to a pound, but occasionally
reaches a foot in length and two or three pounds
in weight. Its color is bright olive-green, with
silvery reflections, darker on the back, and paling
to the belly. In some localities it is of a much
darker and purplish hue with brassy lustre. It is
profusely covered with dark spots or blotches, as
large as the finger-tips or "chincapins." The
fins are mottled with pale spots on a darker or
olive ground. It is gregarious, being usually
found in schools, and prefers clear water. It is
especially adapted to pond culture, and spawns
in spring or early summer, according to locality;
it prepares its nest in sand, gravel, or on a flat
rock in the same way as the sunfishes. Its food
is the same, also, though it is more partial to
young fish. It is an excellent pan-fish but does
not excel as a game-fish, for though a very free
biter, it does not offer much resistance when
hooked. However, with very light tackle it
affords considerable sport, as it does not cease
biting, usually, until most of the school are
taken.</p>

<p>The usual method of angling for this fish is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
from an anchored boat on ponds or small lakes,
or from the bank. At times it rises pretty well
to the fly, and trolling with a very small spoon is
also successful on lakes. The lightest rods and
tackle should be employed, with hooks Nos. 3 to
5 on gut snells. A small quill float is useful in
very weedy ponds with mossy bottom. The best
bait is a small minnow, though grasshoppers,
crickets, crawfish, cut-bait, or worms are all
greedily taken. Fly-fishing is more successful
during the late afternoon hours until dusk. The
flies should be trout patterns of coachman, gray
drake, black gnat, Henshall, or any of the hackles
on hooks Nos. 4 to 5.</p>

<p>I first became acquainted with the calico-bass
during my residence in Wisconsin, many years
ago. In the vicinity of Oconomowoc it was
known as the silver-bass, though summer visitors
from St. Louis, confusing it with the kindred
species, the crappie, called it "croppie," as the
real crappie is known at Murdoch Lake near
that city. Owing to its greedy, free-biting habits
it was a prime favorite with youthful anglers and
the fair sex; for once a school was located, the
contest was free, fast, and furious until, perhaps,
the entire school was captured. It was frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
taken by black-bass fishers when casting the
minnow or trolling, much to their disgust. Of
course it is always the unexpected that happens,
in fishing as in other affairs of life, and the angler
who was casting a fine minnow for a black-bass,
viewed with disdain if not anger the unlucky
"pickerel," rock-bass, perch, or calico bass that
appropriated&mdash;or, as the English angler has it,
"hypothecated"&mdash;the said choice shiner.</p>

<p>I was once fishing with General Phil Sheridan
and General Anson Stager for black-bass on a
lake near Oconomowoc. When the great telegrapher,
after a beautiful cast near a bed of
rushes, hooked a calico-bass, and was anathematizing
the "measly silver-bass" with all the
dots and dashes of the Morse alphabet, Sheridan
quietly remarked, "Oh, let up, Stager, it is one
of the fortunes of war; better luck next time!"
Stager smiled, gently unhooked the offending
fish, and returned it to the water, saying, "Good-by,
croppie, my regards to the rest of the family;
but don't monkey with my minnow again."</p>

<p>When cruising on the St. Johns, or camping
on some of the fresh-water lakes of Florida, I
have greatly enjoyed both the fishing with light
tackle and the eating of this fine pan-fish. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
there known as the perch, silver perch, or speckled
perch. It may not be out of place to say that
the generic term "bass" is connected only with
salt-water fishes in the Southern states. Fishes
that are known in the Northern states as bass of
some kind become, generically, "perch" in the
South; and the black-bass becomes a "trout" or
jumping-perch. If bait-fishing, one is never at
a loss for bait on the lakes of Florida. The black-bass
and calico-bass lie in open water, adjacent to
the patches of lily-pads or bonnets. Among the
latter frequent the minnows and small fry. To
catch your minnow the bait is also handy. In
the stems of the lilies and bonnets there lies
concealed a small worm, which is readily seen
by splitting the stems. With the worm first
catch your minnow, which is transferred to your
bass hook, which is next cast into clear, deeper
water, to be taken by a black-bass or "speckled
perch." What a simple and admirable arrangement
for the lazy fisherman!</p>

<p>My old friend, Dr. Theodatus Garlick, who
with Dr. H. A. Ackley were the fathers of fish culture
in America, having succeeded in hatching
brook-trout as early as 1853, relates the
following instance of the remarkable tenacity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
life in the calico-bass: "A specimen from which
a drawing was made, was wrapped in a piece of
paper when taken from the water, and carried in
my coat pocket for over four hours, and when
placed in a bucket of water soon revived, and
seems at the present time to enjoy excellent
health. In warm weather, however, it would not,
in all probability, survive so severe a test of its
vital powers." I imagine that this circumstance
happened in winter, and that the fish became
frozen before or after being placed in his pocket;
otherwise I doubt if the fish could have survived
so long, unless the piece of paper was very large
and very wet. I know of many instances occurring
with myself and others where freshly caught
fish have been revived after being frozen for
several hours.</p>


<h3>THE CRAPPIE</h3>

<h4>(<i>Pomoxis annularis</i>)</h4>

<p>The crappie was first described by Rafinesque
in 1818 from specimens collected at the Falls of
the Ohio, near Louisville, Kentucky. He named
it <i>annularis</i>, "having rings," as it was said to
have "a golden ring at the base of the tail,"
but I have never seen it; it does have a gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
ring, however, around the iris of the eye, and this
was probably the occasion of the name.</p>

<p>Like the calico-bass, the crappie has received
a great many local names. In the northern
region of its range it is variously known as
white croppie, crappie, barfish, bachelor, etc., and
in Kentucky as newlight, Campbellite, and tin-mouth,
while farther south it is called silver perch,
speckled perch, goggle-eye, sac-a-lait, shad, etc.
It inhabits the Ohio and Mississippi river basins
from Kansas to Louisiana and Texas, and is
more abundant in Kentucky and other Southern
states than farther north. Its range, however,
has been extended by transplantation to many
states. In general features it resembles the
calico-bass very much, though to the trained eye
the differences are very apparent. It is not quite
so deep nor so robust as the calico-bass. The
mouth is somewhat larger, and the snout more
prominent or projecting on account of a depression
or indentation in front of the eye. The eye
is a little larger, and the membrane of the jaws
is quite thin and transparent, hence one of its
names,&mdash;"tin-mouth." The crappie has but six
spines in the dorsal fin, whereas the calico-bass has
seven, whereby they may be readily distinguished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
It grows to about the same size and weight
as the calico-bass, ten or twelve inches, though
under favorable conditions it grows larger, reaching
a weight of three pounds. I have frequently
taken it as heavy, or a little heavier, in Kentucky,
where many ponds and streams seem peculiarly
fitted for it. In coloration it is much paler than
the calico-bass, and the markings are not so
dark or in such large spots or blotches. It is
silvery olive-green, much mottled with a darker
shade of same color, especially on the back, the
lower sides and belly being more silvery and
seemingly translucent. The dorsal and caudal
fins are much mottled with shades of green,
though the anal fin is almost plain. The iris of
the eye is dark, with a silvery or golden border.</p>

<p>It is found in clear streams and likewise in
still, weedy ponds and bayous, or in all situations
adapted to the large-mouth black-bass, with which
fish it is nearly always associated. It is admirably
suited for pond culture. It is quite gregarious
and loves to congregate about the submerged top
of a fallen tree or sunken brush, and about mill-dams.
It feeds on all small aquatic organisms
and insects and their larvæ, and the fry of other
fishes, tadpoles, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>While a very free-biting fish, its game qualities,
when hooked, are not remarkable. It is pulled
out with scarcely a struggle. It is rather a shy
fish, withal, and must be fished for cautiously,
and with little noise or confusion. When these
precautions are observed, and with very small
minnows for bait, nearly the entire school can be
captured in a short time. It is an excellent pan-fish,
and on this account is a prime favorite.</p>

<p>For still-fishing, a light rod of a few ounces in
weight, and a line of the smallest caliber, size H,
should be used. Hooks for bait-fishing should
be about No. 3, as the crappie has a large mouth;
they should be tied on gut snells. A quill float
is useful in weedy places, or about brush and
logs. The best bait is a very small minnow,
hooked under the dorsal fin, care being taken not
to injure the spinal cord. Soft crawfish, cut-bait,
or earthworms may be substituted where minnows
are scarce. A reel is not necessary for bait-fishing,
but a short leader should always be used,
and where required a split-shot sinker is heavy
enough.</p>

<p>For fly-fishing, the lightest trout fly-rod and
the smallest click reel should be employed, with
a braided, enamelled silk line of the smallest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
caliber, and dark or grayish flies of small size, on
hooks No. 4, on gut snells, with a fine leader.
The most useful flies are gray, red, and black
hackles, black gnat, blue dun, gray and brown
drake, and stone fly; but far the best fly that I
have ever used is the Henshall of a small size.
It has a body of green peacock harl, hackle of
white hairs from a deer's tail, gray wings, and
tail of a fibre or two from the tail feather of a
peacock; they will rise to this fly when no other
will tempt them to the surface. Toward sunset,
with the tackle named, on a breezy summer day,
the angler will be amply rewarded, for under
these conditions fly-fishing for the crappie is a
sport not to be despised.</p>

<p>It has been alleged that the name "Campbellite,"
by which the crappie is sometimes known
in Kentucky, was bestowed because the fish first
appeared in Kentucky streams about the same
time that the religious sect founded by Alexander
Campbell became established in that state. This
may have been the origin of the name, but I am
inclined to doubt it from the fact that the crappie
has probably always inhabited Kentucky streams,
inasmuch as it was first described by Rafinesque
in 1820 from Kentucky waters. He gave gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ring and silver perch as the common names then
in vogue for it at Louisville. I think it more
likely the name originated in this wise: among
the many names given to this fish is "newlight,"
probably owing to its bright and apparently
translucent appearance; and as this name was
also bestowed by some on the religious sect
referred to, the names newlight and Campbellite
became interchangeable for both fish and sect.
It is, however, seldom called Campbellite, while
newlight is the most universal name for it in
central Kentucky.</p>

<p>The name crappie, or croppie, has an unknown
derivation; perhaps it comes from the French
<i>crêpe</i>, a "pan-cake," from its shape or deliciousness
when fried, for it was always a great favorite
with the French of St. Louis and the creoles of
Louisiana. In the latter state it is also known as
<i>sac-à-lait</i>, "bag for milk" (?).</p>

<p>Great numbers of crappies are annually seined
from the shallow bayous and sloughs bordering
the Illinois and Mississippi rivers by the United
States Fish Commission, and planted in suitable
waters. If allowed to remain in the sloughs,
which dry up in the summer and fall, they would
eventually perish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BASS FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Serranidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>The bass family is composed mostly of marine
fishes, nearly all of which are good game and
food-fishes. These will be described among the
fishes of the East Coast and Florida in subsequent
pages. It is the most typical group among
the percoid (perchlike) fishes. Only two species
of the family inhabit fresh water,&mdash;the white-bass
and the yellow-bass.</p>

<p>The fishes of this family are characterized by
an oblong body, large mouth, brushlike or bristle-like
teeth, sometimes with canines; one or two
dorsal fins, the first always composed of spiny
rays; the anal fin, always with three spines;
scales adherent and rough (ctenoid); preopercle
usually serrate; opercle with flat points or spines;
cheeks and opercles always scaly; premaxillary
protractile; dorsal and ventral outlines do not
always correspond; caudal fin not deeply forked;
its peduncle stout.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE WHITE-BASS</h3>

<h4>(<i>Roccus chrysops</i>)</h4>

<p>The white-bass was first described by Rafinesque
in 1820 from the falls of the Ohio River,
near Louisville, Kentucky. He named it <i>chrysops</i>,
or "gold eye," owing to the golden hue of
the iris. It is known also as white lake-bass
and fresh-water striped-bass. It is abundant in
Lake Erie, Lake Michigan, and upper Mississippi
River, especially in Lake Pepin, and in Lake
Winnebago, Wisconsin. It was formerly not
uncommon in the Ohio River, but is now rare.
Its body is compressed and rather deep, with
the back arched; its head is rather small, but
the mouth is large, with the lower jaw protruding;
the eye is large; teeth brushlike, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
canines. The color is silvery white, greenish
above, golden below, with six or more narrow
dusky lines along the body, most conspicuous
above the lateral line; those below broken, or not
continuous. The white-bass is found in water
of moderate depth, preferring those that are clear
and cool, as it does not resort to weedy situations.
It is essentially a lake fish, except in spring, when
it undergoes a semi-migration, entering the tributaries
of lakes in large schools. It spawns usually
in May. It feeds on small fishes, crawfish, insects,
and their larvæ, etc. Its usual size is a
pound or a little less, but occasionally it grows
to three pounds. It is a food-fish of much
excellence, its flesh firm, white, flaky, and of
good flavor.</p>

<p>It is one of the best fresh-water game-fishes,
being a bold biter, and on light and suitable
tackle affords much sport to the appreciative
angler. For fly-fishing, the best season is during
the spring, when it enters the tributary streams
of lakes. At this time the fly-fisher will be
successful at any hour of the day. He may fish
from the bank or from an anchored boat, the
latter plan being the best. As the fish are
swimming in schools, either headed up or down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
stream, no particular place need be selected,
though off the points at the edge of the channel,
or in the narrowest portions of the streams, are
perhaps the best. In the summer and fall the fish
are in the lakes or deeper water, when the fishing
will be more successful during the late afternoon
hours until sundown, and the angler may be
guided by the conditions followed in black-bass
fly-fishing, as mentioned in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>A trout fly-rod of six or seven ounces, with the
usual trout click reel and corresponding tackle,
will subserve a good purpose. When the fish
are running in the streams the most useful flies
are gray drake, green drake, stone fly, brown
hackle, gray hackle, Henshall, and Montreal, of
the usual trout patterns, on hooks Nos. 5 to 7.</p>

<p>For bait-fishing, a light black-bass or trout
rod, with multiplying reel, braided silk line of
the smallest caliber, a leader of small gut three
feet long, and hooks Nos. 3 or 4 tied on gut
snells, will answer well. The best and in fact
the only bait that can be successfully used is
a small minnow, hooked through the lips. The
fishing is done from an anchored boat on lakes
or the deep pools of streams, either by casting
or still-fishing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>No fish will rise to the artificial fly except in
comparatively shallow water, or when near the
surface, and this is especially true of the white-bass
when it resorts to the depths after the
spring run is over. I remember a striking instance
of this that once occurred in Wisconsin.
I was fishing for black-bass in the Neenah channel
of Lake Winnebago during the May-fly
season, when the black-bass were taking the
artificial fly right along, being near the surface
feeding on the natural flies, though the water
was quite deep, with a rocky bottom. A party
of bait-fishers anchored near my boat, and began
fishing with heavy sinkers, as the water was very
swift, and with small minnows for bait. The
white-bass were not slow in taking the proffered
minnows, and they caught a goodly number, but
not a single black-bass; nor did I take a single
white-bass during several hours of fishing, for
they were lying among the rocks at the bottom.</p>

<p>In the rocky coves about the Bass Islands
of Put-in-Bay, on Lake Erie, I have had really
good sport, in the summer months, bait-fishing
for white-bass, with light tackle, the fish running
about two pounds; but with the fly my success
was generally <i>nil</i>, as they were in deep water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and nothing but minnows would attract them.
But in the upper Mississippi, notably on Lake
Pepin, the case was different. About the rocky
points of that beautiful lake, and in the clear
water of the river below, I have enjoyed royal
sport fly-fishing for white-bass. This was years
ago. Afterward I made a trip in a steam yacht
from Cincinnati to St. Paul, traversing the
Mississippi from Cairo to the head of navigation,
and also going up the St. Croix River to
Taylor's Falls. On this trip the white-bass fishing
was not so good as in former years, though
the black-bass seemed to have held their own
pretty well. I might remark, in passing, that
the upper Mississippi is one of the most beautiful
and scenic rivers in the world, and is unsurpassed
for black-bass fly-fishing. At one time the
islands of that river furnished superb woodcock
shooting in summer, which could be varied with
fine fishing.</p>


<h3>THE YELLOW-BASS</h3>

<h4>(<i>Morone interrupta</i>)</h4>

<p>The yellow-bass was first described by Dr.
Theodore Gill in 1860. His type specimens
were from the lower Mississippi River in the
vicinity of St. Louis and New Orleans. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
named it <i>interrupta</i>, in allusion to the broken or
"interrupted" lines along its sides. It is also
known as brassy-bass. It belongs to the same
genus as the white-perch of the East Coast. It
is found only in the lower Mississippi River and
its tributaries, sometimes extending its range a
short distance up the Ohio River.</p>

<p>The yellow-bass might be called a cousin of
the white-bass, though it belongs to a different
genus. It takes the place of that fish in the
lower Mississippi Valley. Compared with the
white-bass it has a somewhat longer head, with
a body not quite so deep; otherwise the general
shape is much the same. The mouth is a little
larger, though the snout does not project quite so
much, and the profile of the head is straighter,
and it has a larger eye. The posterior border of
the cheek-bone is finely serrated.</p>

<p>The general color is brassy or yellowish,
darker on the back and lighter on the belly.
There are about half a dozen very distinct and
black longitudinal lines along the sides, the lower
ones broken or "interrupted," the posterior portions
dropping below the anterior, like a "fault"
in a stratum of rocks.</p>

<p>It is fond of the deeper pools in the rivers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
clearwater bayous, and the foot of rapids and
riffles. It is partial to the same character of food
as the white-bass, small minnows constituting the
greater part. It likewise spawns in the spring,
and grows to a pound or two in weight, sometimes
reaching three pounds. It is an excellent
food-fish.</p>

<p>I have had good sport with the yellow-bass
on St. Francis River in Arkansas, and at the
head of the Yazoo Pass, in Mississippi, with the
same tackle and by similar methods as recommended
for the white-bass on a prior page. As
with the two black-basses and the two crappies,
the white-bass and yellow-bass having similar
habits and kindred tastes, the same tackle and the
same modes of angling are as well suited for one
as for the other. This will apply to both fly-fishing
and bait-fishing.</p>

<p>I was once, one autumn, with a party on a river
steam yacht on the lower Mississippi when geese,
ducks, deer, and turkeys were more plentiful than
they are now. Up the St. Francis River, in the
"sunk lands" of Arkansas, the yacht was moored
at Cow Bayou, near a steep clay bluff, on the top
of which was a dilapidated tent occupied by a
young man and his wife, who were building a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
shanty boat in which to float down to sunnier
climes for the winter, as the man was "nigh
gone" with consumption. One morning I was
out early fishing for yellow-bass after a rainy
night. As I was landing a fish I saw the woman
at the top of the bluff, looking for a way down to
the yacht. She was quite a fresh and comely-looking
woman, too. She started down very
carefully, for the wet clay was quite slippery. I
became interested to see how she would succeed.
Suddenly her bare feet slipped from under her,
and she came down with a rush, her one garment,
as I soon discovered, an old calico gown, slipping
back over her head, disclosing her nude form,
which appeared very white in contrast to the red
clay. Then I looked the other way just as she
flopped over from a prone to a supine position.
When she reached the river side she looked like
a sculptor's model in clay. She quietly adjusted
her gown as if nothing unusual had occurred,
and asked: "Has you-uns got any matches?
We-uns' matches all got wet in the drizzle last
night, and I want to cook my old man's breakfus."
I pulled ashore and handed her my matchbox,
and scarcely knowing what to say, I remarked.
"You had better change your dress before you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
cook breakfast." She replied, "I hain't got another
one."</p>

<p>While the boys were eating their breakfast of
fried fish, deer steak, and broiled duck, I related
the "toboggan" episode, and mentioned the "one
frock." When the meal was concluded the boys
overhauled their belongings and chipped in several
pairs of slippers, long woollen stockings, underclothing,
and blankets, and the "skipper" threw in
some calico and muslin from the yacht's stores.
These were made into bundles and carried to the
top of the bluff by a more circuitous route. Proceeding
to the tent they deposited their offerings,
together with some ducks and venison. The
man and woman were overcome with gratitude,
but the boys said they were glad to get rid of the
stuff. The skipper had taken his camera along to
get a snap-shot at the tent and its occupants, which
being made known to them the woman said.
"Wait a minnit!" She went into the tent, but
immediately reappeared wearing a large sun-bonnet,
in which she was "took" with her "old
man." I have often wondered since why she put
on that sun-bonnet. My excuse for this digression
may be found in the memorable words of George
Dawson, "It is not all of fishing to fish."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE BASS FAMILY (<i>CONTINUED</i>)</h3>

<h4>(<i>Serranidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>In addition to the fresh-water species of this
family and those of the East Coast are the groupers,
cabrillas, etc., of Florida waters, to be noticed
later. The family name is founded on Cuvier's
genus <i>Serranus</i>, from the Latin <i>serra</i>, or "saw," in
allusion to the serrated edge of the cheek-bones,
common to all fishes of this family.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Roccus lineatus.</i> The Striped-bass. Body rather elongate, little
compressed; head 3-1/4; depth 3-1/2; eye 6; D. IX-I, 12; A. III,
11; scales 8-67-11; back little arched; head subconical; mouth
large, maxillary reaching middle of orbit; lower jaw projecting;
teeth on base of tongue in two parallel patches; preorbital
entire; preopercle weakly serrate; margin of subopercle entire;
suprascapula entire; gill-rakers long and slender, 4 + 15; dorsal
fins separate; caudal fin forked.</p>

<p><i>Morone americana.</i> The White-perch. Body oblong, ovate, the
back moderately elevated; head 3; depth 2-1/2; eye 4; D. IX-I,

broad bands, the canines small; preopercle serrate; gill-rakers
long, about <i>x</i> + 18; scales on cheeks in 11 rows; caudal fin
double concave or three-lobed.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE STRIPED-BASS</h3>

<h4>(<i>Roccus lineatu</i>)</h4>

<p>The specific name <i>lineatus</i>, or "striped," was
bestowed by Bloch in 1792. North of the Delaware
River it is universally called striped-bass,
but in more southern waters it is known as rock
or rockfish, from its habit of foraging on rocky
shores in search of crustaceans and small fishes.
From this vernacular name comes the generic
name <i>Roccus</i>. It is found from the Gulf of St.
Lawrence to Florida, but is most abundant from
Buzzards Bay to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.
It has been successfully transplanted to the Pacific
coast, where it is now common near San Francisco.</p>
<div class="image" id="illo_126">
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_126.jpg">SURF-FISHING FOR BASS</a></p>
</div>

<p>The form of the striped-bass varies considerably
with age. Young specimens are rather slender
and symmetrical in outline, the depth being about
a fourth of the length. The depth increases
with the weight of the fish, while the back becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
more arched, and the belly more pendulous.
The head equals in length the depth of the
body usually. The mouth is large, opening obliquely;
the snout is rather sharp, and the lower
jaw projects. The color is olivaceous, often
bluish on the back, sides with silvery lustre, fading
to white on the belly. There are six to eight
horizontal rows of dark spots, forming interrupted
stripes, four or five running from head to caudal
fin, with three shorter ones below; the fins are
pale and usually unmarked. It is found within
the range given during the entire year, though
it frequents certain situations at different seasons.
The largest fish resort to the rocky shores of the
bays and indentations of the coast between the
shores and outer reefs, those of smaller size frequent
the estuaries and tideways, and still smaller
ones seek the shallower and quieter waters.</p>

<p>It spawns in the spring, usually in May, in
both fresh and brackish water. Large schools
ascend rivers for long distances in the spring,
more particularly those rivers resorted to by
the shad, which they seem to follow, perhaps for
the purpose of feeding on shad spawn, as they
are said to do. Others follow the smelt up certain
rivers farther north. A large female will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
deposit from a million to two million eggs, which
are about one-seventh of an inch in diameter, are
free, transparent, and semi-buoyant, and hatch in
a few days. Owing to a large oil-drop in the
front part of the yolk-sac, the young fry at first
swim with the head toward the surface of the
water, and not in the horizontal position usual
with the fry of most fishes.</p>

<p>Its food consists of small fishes, crabs, lobsters,
shrimps, squids, sandworms, and other marine
invertebrates. It grows to a very large size,
being frequently taken by anglers from thirty to
sixty pounds, and in the nets of fishermen as
heavy as one hundred pounds or more. In the
city of Baltimore, in boyhood days, I often went
to the fish markets on Saturdays to see and admire
the various kinds of fishes. On one occasion
there were several large rockfish being
weighed on the old-time balance, consisting of
a beam and two large, flat, wooden scales supported
by chains. The largest fish did not weigh
quite two fifty-six-pound weights. A man then
asked me how much I weighed, and I replied
one hundred and three pounds. I was then
placed on the scale instead of the weights, with
the result that the fish outweighed me perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a pound or two. At all events it weighed between
one hundred and three and one hundred
and twelve pounds&mdash;probably one hundred and
five pounds. It was as long as an average man.</p>

<p>The striped-bass is a food-fish of fine quality,
and the markets of the eastern cities are well
supplied with it during summer and fall, and to
a certain extent during the winter. It is very
active from early spring until late in the fall,
when it resorts to the back-waters and bayous of
tidal rivers for the winter. It is said by some to
hibernate, but this is doubtful. The opinion is
probably due to the fact that it is more sluggish
and listless while in winter quarters, and refuses
to respond to the wiles of the angler.</p>

<p>That the striped-bass is a game-fish of high
degree goes without saying. It is rated by some
enthusiastic anglers as being superior even to the
salmon in game qualities. This opinion, however,
is hardly correct when the two are compared
weight for weight. In surf-fishing the first
rush of a large fish, upon feeling the hook, is
something to be remembered. It is probably
longer and stronger than that of a salmon of
equal weight, for the reason that while the latter
fish is leaping from the water in its efforts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
escape, the bass is making his furious dash for
liberty beneath the surface, and exerting every
ounce of his muscular fibre in the effort. But
this immense strain cannot long be continued,
and as he seldom breaks water like the salmon,
and does not sulk, he resorts to strategy and
finesse to free himself.</p>

<p>After making several desperate but ineffectual
rushes to escape, he may endeavor to chafe or
part the line against sharp rocks, or to foul it
among the kelp or sea-weeds. Sometimes, but
not often, he dives toward the angler to obtain
slack line, which is a dangerous move if the reel
does not respond quickly in taking up the loose
line. When it is considered that all of these
man&oelig;uvres of a monster bass to free himself
occur amidst the rolling and tumbling of the
surf, or in the dashing of foam-crested combers,
while the angler often has but a precarious footing
on a slippery rock, and perhaps with a half
gale of wind blowing, some idea may be formed
of the skill and good judgment required to subdue
and land so valorous a fish. And under
such conditions it is very natural for the angler
to rank his noble quarry with the salmon.</p>
<div class="image" id="illo_132">
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_132.jpg">CATCHING SEA-BASS OFF NEWPORT</a></p>
</div>

<p>When a Baltimore boy I thought there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
better sport than still-fishing for rockfish running
from a half to a pound or two, on the flats off
Fort McHenry, the Lazaretto, or up the Patapsco
River near the Long Bridge. It was good sport,
too, for the fish were plentiful in those days, and
from an anchored boat, with light cane rod and
shrimp bait, I was often on the ground to catch
the young flood tide at sunrise, or before, on
summer mornings, and seldom failed to be rewarded
with a full basket of small striped-bass.</p>

<p>Still-fishing in summer is best practised in
comparatively shallow water in the estuaries, at
the edge of the tideways, near the mouths of
rivers, or up streams of good size as far as the
tide reaches. In some cases the fishing may be
done from bridges, piers, wharves, or from the
bank, but usually from an anchored boat. In
the estuaries and at the mouths of rivers the
first of the flood and the last of the ebb are usually
the best stages of the tide. In the shallow
bays and lagoons, or far up the rivers, the full
tide is the most favorable time. For this fishing
the rod should be light, pliable, and not more
than nine feet in length. A black-bass rod can
be utilized to good advantage. The best rod for
the purpose, however, is the "Little Giant," a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
modification of the Henshall black-bass rod. It
is in two pieces, seven and one-half feet long, and
weighs eight ounces in ash and lancewood, or
seven ounces in split bamboo. It is stiffer than
the Henshall rod, so that a two or four-ounce
sinker can be used with it whenever necessary.
A good multiplying reel must be employed with
black-bass rods. The line should be fifty yards
of braided linen, smallest size, with a three-foot
leader of single gut; Sproat or O'Shaughnessy
hooks Nos. 1 or 2 on gut snells are large enough
for bass up to two or three pounds. A small
float is useful on grassy bottom with shrimp or
crab bait, and sinkers of weights in accordance
with the strength of the tidal current must be
employed, also a landing-net.</p>

<p>Shrimps, soft or shedder crabs, soft-shelled
clams, sandworms, small minnows, silversides,
spearing or killifishes, are all good baits in their
season. Shrimp is perhaps the best all-round
lure. It should be hooked under the back plates,
and a single shrimp is sufficient for small bass.
Shedder or soft crab should be cut in small
pieces. The scallop is likewise an attractive
bait, especially in the fall, when clam bait may
also be used to advantage. Early in the spring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
shad roe may be used in quiet waters, or at
slack tide, but it is a difficult and unpleasant
bait to handle.</p>

<p>The bait should be from one to three feet
above the bottom, and should be kept in motion.
Even crab bait should not be allowed to lie on
the bottom, as some anglers advise. To maintain
the proper position and depth of the bait
the angler may employ a float, with or without
a sinker, as the exigencies or conditions demand.</p>

<p>Very often hand-lines or stiff cane poles are
used in estuary fishing, and the bass, even when
of several pounds in weight, are yanked out of
the water into the boat at once. But with the
tackle recommended above the pleasure of the
angler is enhanced, and the fish given a chance
for his life in the brief struggle that follows.</p>

<p>In trolling for fish of from three to ten pounds
a natural bamboo rod, eight or nine feet long,
answers well with one hundred yards of braided
linen line, size E or F, and Sproat hooks No. 2-0
to 3-0 on gut snells. Where the bass run
larger, two hundred feet of line, size E, with
hooks Nos. 5-0 to 6-0 may be required, also a
heavier rod. The baits for trolling are bloodworms
of large size, a minnow hooked through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the lips, the natural squid or an eel-tail; also
the artificial squid of bone or block tin, or a
trolling-spoon or spinner with a single hook.
When the spoon or artificial squid is used it is
not necessary or advisable to add sandworms
or other natural bait, as is often done. Employ
one or the other, but never both in combination.
The artificial baits are sufficiently attractive
in themselves, and the additions mentioned
do not enhance their effectiveness. The boat
should be rowed alongshore, or over rocky
reefs or shoals, and about the eddies of rock
pools. As the fish always hooks itself in trolling,
it only remains for the angler to play and
land his quarry in good form, always having a
large landing-net or gaff in the boat.</p>

<p>Casting menhaden bait from the rocky shores
of the coast requires tools and tackle of great
excellence and strength, as the largest bass are
taken in this way. The most approved rod is
a first-class split-bamboo, eight or eight and
one-half feet long, and weighing from twelve to
sixteen ounces. A more serviceable rod, that is,
one that will admit of harder usage, is made of
greenheart, lancewood, or bethabara, of the same
length, but somewhat heavier. A cheaper rod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
but one that will give good satisfaction, and
withal is lighter than a wooden rod, is made of
natural male Calcutta bamboo, and is known
as a "chum" rod. Rods of eight or eight and
one-half feet in length should be made in two
or three pieces, or if not exceeding seven and
one-half feet may be made of one six-foot piece
with a handle of eighteen inches. They should
have double bell-mouth guides and funnel top.
The more expensive rods should have the
guides, or at least the funnel top, lined with
agate.</p>

<p>The reel must be a first-class multiplier, made
expressly for surf-fishing, with jewelled or steel
bearings, with a capacity of two hundred yards
of from twelve to eighteen-thread Cuttyhunk line.
The hooks should be knobbed Sproat or
O'Shaughnessy, Nos. 5-0 to 7-0, and attached
to the line by two half-hitches, the loose end
turned up and secured by another half-hitch.
A long-handled gaff-hook of good steel and
very sharp is indispensable. A chum knife
and spoon are also necessary, and a woollen
thumb-stall will be needed for thumbing the
reel, or a piece of leather may be affixed to one of
its bars as a brake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The bait for casting may be the tail of a
lobster, cleaned of every vestige of shell, but
menhaden bait is generally used. After scaling
the fish, a slice of several inches is cut from its
side, tail end, and scored on the flesh side longitudinally
with a sharp knife, to admit of its
being more readily folded along the hook, which
it should envelop completely. The small end
of the bait is affixed to the head of the hook
by a half-hitch or two, its bend and barb being
concealed by the broader end of the bait. This
is the conventional method of baiting, though
I have had good success in more southern
waters by using an entire bait of mullet or
other silvery fish, five or six inches in length,
and hooked through the lips.</p>

<p>The residue of the menhaden, after the baits
are cut off, is chopped fine, and is known as
"chum." This is thrown in the water to attract
the bass. It is called "chumming," and causes
an oily "slick" that spreads over the surface
for a long distance. The pieces of cut fish
thrown in are soon swallowed by scup, cunners,
bass, and other fishes, leaving nothing but the
oily slick on the surface. The bluefish, being a
surface feeder, is probably attracted by the slick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
but it is questionable if it is noticed by the
striped-bass, a bottom and mid-water feeder.
And even if the common belief were true, it is
not likely that the bass would be tolled directly
toward the angler through a slick covering
many acres. The real attraction is in the
chopped menhaden that sinks below the surface.</p>

<p>Casting the menhaden is quite an art. It is
somewhat in the nature of casting a minnow for
black-bass as described on a previous page,
though the rod is a two-handed one and the bait
much heavier. The bait is reeled up to within
a foot or two of the rod tip, and the rod grasped
by both hands, one just above and one below the
reel, with the thumb of the lower hand resting on
the spool of the reel, and protected by a woollen
or leather thumb-stall. With the rod at one side,
it is given a preliminary whirl, or swing or two,
and the bait cast, underhand, much like striking
at a hip-high or shoulder-high ball with a bat.
The cast is made from either side, and while
some anglers place the right hand below in casting
from both sides, it is not the best way. In
casting from the right side the left hand should
be below, and the reel controlled by the left
thumb; while in casting from the left side the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
right hand should be below. The thumb should
maintain a gentle and uniform pressure on the
spool as it revolves, to prevent backlashing, and
by a stronger pressure stop the revolution of the
spool as the bait reaches the water.</p>

<p>As long a cast is made as possible, and when
the bait settles it should be reeled in again very
slowly and the cast repeated until the bait is
taken by a bass. When the water is very rough,
so as to churn the bait and keep it in constant
motion, fewer casts are necessary, as the bait can
be left in the water for a longer time before
making a new cast. When the fish is hooked
and starts on his initial rush, line should be
given, the thumb always on the spool to check
him when it can be done without endangering
the tackle. His first rush will probably be his
strongest, and he must then be killed on the rod
and reeled in to the gaffer. During the struggle
of playing the fish, great care must be observed
to prevent the cutting or chafing of the line
against sharp rocks, and to keep the fish away
from weeds, timbers, or other obstructions.</p>

<p>As the bass may weigh anywhere from ten to
fifty pounds, the utmost skill and precaution are
necessary to land him safely. Very often the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
angler has not only to contend with the fish, but
with the strength and undertow of the tide and
the tossing of breakers&mdash;factors that are by no
means to be despised or neglected. But once
fairly gaffed, the angler may feast his eyes on the
grand fish, weighing, perhaps, thirty pounds or
more, and congratulate himself on a great achievement.</p>

<p>When the bass are running far up the fresh-water
streams in the spring, they will often take
the artificial fly. As the fish do not run much
heavier than black-bass, the rod and tackle used
in fly-fishing for that fish can be utilized, employing
such flies as oriole, polka, coachman, red ibis,
or other showy creations. The fishing is more
successful about sundown.</p>

<p>Many years ago the striped-bass was planted
in the waters of the Pacific coast by the United
States Fish Commission. It has multiplied exceedingly,
so that bass-fishing is now a favorite
sport with San Francisco anglers, who fish the
neighboring bays, rivers, and sloughs with great
success. The baits commonly used are clams
and the trolling-spoon. The sport has culminated
in the formation of several striped-bass clubs,
with quite a large membership.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE WHITE-PERCH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Morone americana</i>)</h4>

<p>The white-perch was described, but not named,
by Shöpf, in 1788, from the waters near New
York. From his description Gmelin named it,
in the same year, <i>Perca americana</i>, or "American
perch." The genus <i>Morone</i> was established
for it in 1814 by Dr. Mitchill, as owing to structural
differences it could not properly be placed
in the genus <i>Perca</i>.</p>

<p>The white-perch is one of the most abundant
fishes of the brackish waters on the Atlantic
coast, its range extending from Nova Scotia to
South Carolina, but more especially from Cape
Cod to Cape Hatteras. It is also landlocked in
fresh-water ponds at various places along the
coast.</p>

<p>It is a handsome fish, symmetrical in outline,
and well proportioned. Its body is compressed, its
depth is not quite a third of its length. Its head
is as long as the depth of the body, depressed
above the eyes, and with a somewhat pointed
snout. The mouth is rather small; the teeth are
small, without canines; there are a few teeth
on the edge of the tongue, but none on its base.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
There are two dorsal fins, though they are connected
at the base.</p>

<p>Its color is olivaceous, or green of various
shades on the head and back, with silvery or
greenish sides, and silvery white belly. Sometimes
the color is bluish on the back and head.
Those confined in ponds are always darker in
hue.</p>

<p>The white-perch is one of the best and most
esteemed pan-fishes of the eastern coast. It
grows to a foot or more in length, occasionally
weighing three pounds; but the usual size is
from six to nine inches, and from one-half to a
pound in weight in brackish water. Smaller
ones ascend the streams to fresh water. It is
usually found associating with small striped-bass,
and their habits are much alike, feeding on the
same food, as small minnows, young eels, shrimp,
etc. It spawns in the spring, usually in May, in
shallow, weedy situations in both fresh and brackish
water. The eggs are quite small, about forty
thousand to a fish, and hatch in three or four days.</p>

<p>As a boy I was very fond of fishing for white-perch,
which were then very abundant in the
Spring Garden branch of the Patapsco River, at
Baltimore, from Ferry Bar to the mud-flats near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
the Long Bridge, and also above the bridge on
the main river in brackish water. Being gregarious,
it was found in large schools, and was a free
biter at shrimps, shedder-crab, small minnows,
and earthworms. At the time of which I write
it was very plentiful at the mouths of all tidal
rivers emptying into Chesapeake Bay. I have
seen great wagon loads brought ashore in one
haul of a long market seine. And in camping
along the Bay, during my summer vacations, they
seemed to be as plentiful as blackberries. There
was never any dearth of fried white-perch or
other fishes in our camp, and we never tired of
them. We feasted on them daily, with terrapin,
soft-shelled crabs, oysters, green corn, tomatoes,
cantaloupes, and watermelons, and all to be had
for the mere catching or asking.</p>

<p>Any light rod may be used for white-perch,
with or without a small multiplying reel, with a
line of braided linen, smallest size, and hooks
Nos. 6 to 8. Most anglers use two or three
hooks, but I would advise a single hook for all
kinds of fishing. A short leader of single gut,
about three feet long, is an advantage, and hooks
should be tied on gut snells.</p>

<p>In quiet water, with small, live minnows for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
bait, a sinker or float need not be used. In tidal
waters a sinker is necessary to keep the bait at
mid-water, or a few feet from the bottom, especially
when shrimp, crab, or earthworms are used
for bait. The weight of the sinker must be
adapted to the strength of the tide. The best
season is during late summer or autumn in
brackish water, from an anchored boat, at half-flood
or half-ebb tide; up the tidal rivers at
high tide. At low water they must be looked
for in the deep holes, among the rocks. Wherever
found the white-perch will not disappoint
the angler, but is ever ready to respond to his
baited hook.</p>

<p>It rises pretty well to the artificial fly, especially
when landlocked in ponds, or far up the streams.
Trout tackle and trout flies are just right, on
hooks Nos. 7 or 8; and as the most favorable
time for fishing is toward dusk, light-colored flies
are the best, as coachman, gray drake, red ibis,
oriole, etc.</p>

<p>I was once fishing for white-perch on Gunpowder
River, in Maryland, with a companion
who happened to lose one of his hooks through
a defective snell, which, however, he soon recovered
by catching the perch that had stolen it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
We were perfectly sure that it was his, as he had
tied his hooks himself with a peculiar shade of
sewing silk. He then marked the fish by clipping
off a portion of one of the spines of the
dorsal fin, and returned it to the water, only to be
retaken three times, twice by my friend and once
by myself. The lips of the perch being then
quite ragged from the frequent hooking, it was
humanely killed and deposited in the basket.</p>

</div>

<p>From my experience with both wild and domesticated
fish I am quite sure that cold-blooded
animals, like fishes and batrachians, are not very
sensitive to pain. Owing to the very small brain
and the gelatinous character of the spinal marrow
of fishes, it is very doubtful if they suffer much,
if any, pain from the infliction of so slight an
injury as the pricking of a fish-hook. If it were
otherwise, I do not think a hooked fish would
offer so much resistance and pull so hard upon
the hook if it caused much pain. Nor does it
seem reasonable that a fish would repeatedly subject
itself to the same experience if its mouth
felt at all sore, as all experienced anglers know
they do, time and again. The mouth and throat
of a fish cannot be very sensitive when it is considered
that it swallows, whole, such prey as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sunfish and catfish fry, bristling with sharp fins
and spines, and those of the catfish are always
erect, even if swallowed head first. Marine fishes
also swallow crabs, lobsters, prawns, besides mollusks,
sea-urchins, and other creatures that would
be exceedingly irritating and painful to a sensitive
throat.</p>



<h3>THE SEA-BASS</h3>

<h4>(<i>Centropristes striatus</i>)</h4>

<p>The sea-bass is known in various localities as
black sea-bass, black will, black harry, hannahills,
humpback, and also by names belonging rightly
to other well-known fishes, as blackfish, bluefish,
and rock-bass. The name sea-bass, however,
is in most general use, and is the most distinctive
and appropriate. Linnæus described it briefly, in
1758, and named it <i>striatus</i>, or "striped." He
afterward received specimens from South Carolina,
which in 1766 he named <i>atraria</i>, or "blackish,"
but the older name must hold according to
the law of priority.</p>

<p>It is confined to the Atlantic coast, with
range extending from Cape Cod to Florida, but
it is most abundant along the coast of New
Jersey. It has a robust body, its depth not quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
a third of its length; the back is elevated over
the shoulder, the "hump" being more prominent
in males during the breeding season. The head
is large and thick, with a large, oblique mouth,
leathery lips, and projecting lower jaw. The fin
rays are long and slender, and the caudal fin is
double concave.</p>

<p>Its color is bluish black, sometimes greenish
black or dusky brown on the back and top of the
head, lighter on the sides and belly. The edges
of the scales being dark, give a mottled, streaked,
or reticulated appearance. The dorsal fin has
several series of bluish white elongated spots;
the other fins are bluish or dusky, and are more
or less mottled. Young specimens have a broad
dusky band or stripe along the sides, which later
becomes broken up, forming cross shades.</p>

<p>The sea-bass, as its name implies, is a sea fish,
seldom entering brackish water. It congregates
in large schools about the offshore rocky reefs
and shoals, and about old wrecks, feeding on
crabs, shrimps, and other marine organisms,
often in company with the tautog and porgy.
It is a deep-water fish, and of course a bottom
feeder. It spawns in summer, between May and
August, depending on the temperature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
water, but usually in June. The eggs are quite
small, about twenty-five to the inch, and hatch in
from four to six days. Its usual weight is from
one-half to two or three pounds, occasionally
weighing ten or twelve pounds. It is very
voracious and will take almost any kind of bait
that is offered. It is taken in large numbers by
market fishermen on hand-lines and clam bait.
It commands a ready sale, being a good food-fish,
with firm, flaky flesh of a fine savor, and is
highly valued for chowders. It is a hard-pulling
fish on the line, boring toward the bottom with
vicious tugs.</p>

<p>A light cane chum rod is very suitable, or
perhaps the Little Giant rod is better. It is
seven and one-half feet long and weighs eight
ounces, and will bear the strain of such sinkers as
must be used. The line should be braided linen
of small caliber, and a multiplying reel should
always be used. A short leader of three or four
feet, and Sproat hooks, Nos. 1-0 to 3-0, on silkworm
fibre and a sinker adapted to the strength
of the tide, make up the rest of the tackle. As
the fishing is done from an anchored boat a landing-net
should be provided. With the tackle
just mentioned, at slack tide, and with clam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
shedder-crab, sandworms, or shrimp bait, the
angler can enjoy a good measure of sport with
the sea-bass. Where the tide runs very strong,
compelling the use of heavy sinkers of from
three to six ounces, a striped-bass rod should be
employed, especially in water from fifteen to
thirty feet deep.</p>

<p>Great crowds of men, women, and children
patronize the excursion boats from New York
and Philadelphia, in the summer season, to catch
bass, porgies, tautog, and flounders on the various
fishing banks off the Jersey coast, where they
use hand-lines and clam bait. While such fishing
is greatly enjoyed by the uninitiated, it does
not appeal to the angler.</p>


<h3>THE SOUTHERN SEA-BASS</h3>

<h4>(<i>Centropristes philadelphicus</i>)</h4>

<p>This species was described by Linnæus in
1758, and named <i>philadelphicus</i>, under the
impression that his specimen was from the
vicinity of that city. Afterward he received
specimens from the South Carolina coast, which,
in 1766, he named <i>trifurca</i>, meaning "three-forked,"
in allusion to its "triple-tail." The older
name, unfortunately, must stand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Its color is olive-gray, darkest on the back,
whitish below, with seven oblique dusky and
diffuse bars along the upper portion of the
sides. The three-forked appearance of the caudal
fin is more pronounced than in the northern
sea-bass; otherwise there is no structural difference,
except in coloration. Its habits are similar.
The same remarks apply equally to the
following species, except that it has a few less
gill-rakers than the northern species. They may
eventually all prove to be the same species, or
geographical varieties. The directions as to
fishing apply as well to both these southern
forms as to the northern sea-bass.</p>


<h3>THE GULF SEA-BASS</h3>

<h4>(<i>Centropristes ocyurus</i>)</h4>

<p>This species was described from the "snapper
banks," off Pensacola, by Jordan and Evermann
in 1886, who named it <i>ocyurus</i>, or "swift tail." It
has not been recorded from any other locality.
It agrees with the northern sea-bass, except as
mentioned, and in its coloration, which is grayish
or pale olive, darker on the back, with three longitudinal
rows of black blotches along the sides. It
is called "tally-wag" by the snapper fisherman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PIKE FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Esocidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>The fishes of this family have a long body,
not much compressed, and not elevated. The
head is long, with a flattened and prolonged
snout; a very large mouth filled with long and
very sharp, cardlike teeth on the jaws and roof of
the mouth, and with smaller teeth on the tongue.
They have a single dorsal fin composed entirely
of soft rays, and situated very far back and
opposite to the anal fin, which is likewise composed
of soft rays. The scales are small; the
cheeks and gill-covers are more or less scaly;
the head is naked above. All are greedy, voracious
fishes, marauding tyrants, living almost entirely
on other fishes. There is but one genus,
<i>Esox</i>.</p>

<p>As some anglers find it difficult to distinguish
a large pike from a mascalonge, or a pike from a
pickerel, owing to the similar shape and appearance,
the several species can be easily identified
by means of the following artificial key:</p>

<blockquote><p>The mascalonge (<i>Esox nobilior</i>) has the upper part of both the
cheeks and gill-covers scaly, while the lower half of both cheeks
and gill-covers is naked; it has from 17 to 19 branchiostegal
rays (the branchiostegals are the rays on the under side of the
gill-cover, that, like the ribs of an umbrella, assist in opening
and closing it during breathing). Its coloration is of a uniform
grayish hue, or when marked with spots or bars they are always
of a much darker color or shade than the ground color.</p>

<p>The pike (<i>Esox lucius</i>)has the cheeks entirely scaly, but only the
upper part of the gill-cover, the lower half being naked; it has
from 14 to 16 branchiostegal rays; its coloration is a bluish or
greenish gray, with elongated or bean-shaped spots covering
the sides, and which are always of a lighter hue than the ground
color.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>The eastern or reticulated pickerel (<i>Esox reticulatus</i>) has both the
cheeks and the gill-covers entirely covered with scales; it has
from 14 to 16 branchiostegal rays; its coloration is shades
of green, with sides of golden lustre, and marked with dark reticulations,
mostly horizontal. It is rarely or never found west of
the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>The little western pickerel (<i>Esox vermiculatus</i>) has both cheeks and
gill-covers entirely scaly, as have all the pickerels; it has from 11
to 13, usually 12, branchiostegal rays; its coloration is greenish
or grayish, with curved streaks on the sides forming bars or
reticulations; the color is quite variable, sometimes plain olive.
It is found only west of the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>The banded or American pickerel (<i>Esox americanus</i>) has, like the
other true pickerels, both the cheeks and the gill-covers entirely
covered with scales; it has 12 or 13 branchiostegal rays; coloration
dark green, sides with many distinct black curved transverse
bars; a black bar below the eye, and one from the snout
through the eye to the gill-cover. It is found only east of the
Alleghanies.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE MASCALONGE</h3>

<h4>(<i>Esox nobilior</i>)</h4>

<p>The specific name <i>nobilior</i>, long current for
the mascalonge, and the one based on its earliest
accurate description, was conferred by Rev.
Zadoc Thompson in 1849 in "Notes on Certain
Vermont Fishes," in the Proceedings of the Boston
Society of Natural History, Vol. III, published
July 18, 1849, and later he described it
fully in the "History of Vermont," 1853, Part I.
It is an excellent and appropriate name, and one
that has become familiar to anglers. I have re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>tained
it, inasmuch as it was discarded, I think,
for a very insufficient reason.</p>

<p>The specific name <i>masquinongy</i>, which has recently
been given to this species in the books, is
supposed to have been given to the mascalonge
by Dr. Mitchill in 1824. His description, however,
cannot now be found. It is alluded to by
De Kay in his "Fishes of New York," in 1842,
who gives its reference as "Mirror, 1824, page
297"; but I have searched for it in vain, as have
others. De Kay merely says: "According to
Mitchill, who describes a specimen 47.0 long and
weighing thirty pounds, the fin rays are as follows:
'D. 21; P. 14; V. 11; A. 17; C. 26.' But this
radial formula is just as applicable to Richardson's
<i>E. lucius</i>: 'D. 20; P. 16; A. 18,' also
given by De Kay. The size and weight of
the alleged specimen of Mitchill would seem to
indicate the mascalonge, but the great northern
pickerel, <i>Esox lucius</i>, occasionally reaches a like
size and weight. I once caught one weighing
twenty-five pounds in northern Wisconsin, and
saw several a little heavier, one of fully twenty-eight
pounds."</p>

<p>Dr. Kirtland, in 1838, had, previous to De Kay,
applied Mitchill's name <i>masquinongy</i> to a speci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>men
from Lake Erie, and it is upon this evidence,
principally, that this name has been adopted as
the specific title of the mascalonge.</p>

<p>But afterward Dr. Kirtland used Thompson's
name <i>nobilis</i> (meaning <i>nobilior</i>) and Le Sueur's
name <i>estor</i> for the mascalonge. He also subsequently
described the mascalonge from Lake Erie
as <i>atromaculatus</i>, and one from the Mahoning
River, Ohio, as <i>ohiensis</i>. From this it would appear
that Dr. Kirtland, although a good naturalist
in his day, was not at all clear in his estimation of
the mascalonge.</p>

<p>There has been considerable controversy concerning
the common or vernacular name of the
mascalonge. Some claim it is from the French,
and derived from the words "masque" and "allonge,"
which virtually mean "long face," and
which is certainly nearer to the common pronunciation
of mascalonge or muscalunge. Others
claim it is an Indian name from the Ojibwa language,
as "mash," meaning "strong," and "kinoje,"
meaning "pike." "Mash" is also said to mean
"spotted" and "deformed." From mash and
kinoje come "maskinonge," as it appears in the
statutes of Canada. The name has been spelled
in numerous ways, as evidenced in the Century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Dictionary, which gives the following variations:
maskalonge, mascalonge, maskalunge, maskallonge,
masquallonge, masq'allonge, mascallonge,
muscalonge, muskalonge, muskalinge, muskellunge,
moskalonge, moscononge, maskinonge,
maskanonge, maskenonge, maskenozha, maskinoje,
and maskenonge, to which might be added
muscalinga, mascalinga, etc. There is no authority
or precedent for the name "muskellunge" as
used by some writers and anglers, as neither the
original French or Indian words have the letter
"u" in either the first or last syllable. Moreover,
the term "lunge" is in some sections applied to
the lake trout. I am aware, of course, that the
name has obtained considerable currency, but in
much the same way that the black-bass is called
"trout" in the South, and the pike-perch is denominated
"salmon" in certain localities.</p>

<p>Rev. Zadoc Thompson, who was the first to call
attention to the scaling of the cheeks as a diagnostic
character, gives the vernacular name "masquallonge,"
and attributes it to French derivation, to
which opinion I am inclined. As the most prominent
writers on fish and fishing give it as "mascalonge,"
that name should be universally adopted,
no matter what its origin, or whether derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
from the French Canadians or the Chippeway
Indians; that question is more interesting to
philologists than to anglers. As an instance of
inconsistency, or of the irony of fate, the books
give the scientific name of the subgenus as <i>mascalongus</i>,
from the French, and the specific name
as <i>masquinongy</i>, from the Ojibwa.</p>

<p>The mascalonge is common in the St. Lawrence
basin and the Great Lakes, more abundant
in the lakes of northern Wisconsin, less common
in the upper Mississippi River, Chautauqua Lake.
New York, and Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania,
and rare in the upper Ohio River and tributaries.
It has a long body, somewhat compressed,
its depth being about one-fifth of its
length; the head is large, about a fourth of
the length of the body, and flattened, with the
lower jaw projecting. It has a terrible array of
teeth of assorted sizes. On the edge of each
side of the lower jaw are several long, bayonet-shaped
teeth, from one-half to an inch apart; in
the front part of the tip of the projecting lower
jaw are a few short but sharp teeth, recurved; in
the front part of the upper jaw are three clusters
of long, fanglike teeth, standing out amidst the
smaller, cardlike teeth; on the edge of the for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>ward
half of the upper lip is a row of small, but
very sharp, recurved teeth; back of these on the
roof of the mouth (vomer and palatines), and extending
back from the fangs in front to the throat,
are three rows of cardlike teeth, recurved and
very sharp.</p>

<p>The coloration and markings vary so much
that several varieties have been needlessly established,
as the variations are found in every locality,
and do not seem to depend on habitat or environment.
The usual color is dark gray, greenish
or brownish, always darker on the back,
lighter on the sides, and belly white or whitish.
The fins usually have dusky or slate-colored spots
or blotches; the lower fins and caudal fin are
often reddish. The markings of the body vary a
great deal. In the young the upper half of the
body is covered with small, round black spots,
which usually disappear or change their shape as
they grow old. In mature fish the spots are more
diffuse, sometimes enlarging to an inch or more
in diameter, or by coalescing form vertical broad
bands, while in others there are no distinct dark
markings. And while all of these various markings
are found in fish from the same locality
there is no apparent structural difference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>I have examined and compared specimens from
the St. Lawrence and Indian rivers, New York.
Lake Erie, the Wisconsin lakes, Lake Pepin, Chautauqua
and Conneaut lakes, Scioto and Mahoning
rivers, in Ohio, and have seen preserved heads of
large ones from Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
and found that they all agree so well in the number
of branchiostegals, squamation of cheeks and
opercles, in dentition, fins, and in measurements,
that they must all be considered as one and the
same species. At the Chicago Columbian Exposition
there were some twenty very large specimens
of mounted skins from Canadian waters, in
the exhibit of the Ottawa Museum, which showed
well the variation in markings. Some still showed
the dark spots on a gray ground; others were
more or less distinctly barred with broad or narrow
bands; others showed both bars and diffuse spots;
and still others were of a uniform slate or grayish
coloration, without markings of any kind. In
the museum of the Cuvier Club, in Cincinnati,
there are quite a number of mounted skins of
mascalonge from the Wisconsin lakes, mostly
large ones, that also show all of the various
markings, as well as those of a uniform coloration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>About 1890 I donated to the Cincinnati Society
of Natural History a specimen from Lake Erie;
and in 1892 I donated to the United States National
Museum two specimens from Lake Erie,
and one from a tributary of the Muskingum River,
in Ohio. All of these Ohio fish were from eighteen
inches to two feet long, and all showed similar
markings, being profusely covered with round
black spots from an eighth to a quarter of an
inch in diameter. Where the spots become diffused,
and the bands are inclined to spread and
coalesce, they are always more distinct toward the
tail. In a mascalonge of less than a foot in length
the spots are very black, very round, and quite
small, not exceeding a sixth or an eighth of an inch
in diameter.</p>

<p>Various appellations have been bestowed on
the mascalonge to denote its rapacity, as the
shark, wolf, or tiger of the waters, all of which are
well merited by that fierce marauder. It subsists
entirely on fish, frogs, snakes, and even the young
of aquatic mammals and water fowl. Nothing in
the shape of food comes amiss to him. He is
solitary in his habits, lying concealed among the
water plants and rushes at the edges of the
streams or channels and along the shores, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
beside shelving rocks or banks in clear lakes,
from whence he darts open-mouthed upon the
luckless fish that approaches his lair. The number
of fishes swallowed by a mascalonge during a
single summer is almost incredible; and they are
not minnows and small fry alone, such as are
devoured by other predaceous fishes, but such as
are old and large enough to reproduce their kind.
It is fortunate that the mascalonge is comparatively
a rare fish. As it is now being artificially
propagated in some states, great care and judgment
should be exercised as to the waters planted, so as
not to jeopardize other and better game-fishes.</p>

<p>It spawns early in the spring and in very shallow
water, where most of the eggs are devoured
by frogs, turtles, fishes, and water fowl&mdash;a wise
provision of nature when it is considered that
the female deposits from one hundred thousand
to three hundred thousand eggs. The eggs are
quite small, about ten or twelve to an inch, and
hatch in about two weeks. The mascalonge is
the most valuable food-fish of its family, and is
pronounced by some as being really excellent;
but I consider it much inferior to the whitefish,
lake-trout, pike-perch, black-bass, or brook-trout.
While possessing no especial flavor, its flesh is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
firm and flaky, more so than that of the pike or
pickerel, and it commands a ready sale in the
markets.</p>

<p>It grows occasionally to an enormous size. I
have taken it up to forty pounds, good weight.
The late Judge Potter, of Toledo, Ohio, an angler
of the old school, informed me that he had seen,
in early days, many that weighed from fifty to
seventy-five pounds. Mr. L. H. McCormick, formerly
of Oberlin College, Ohio, saw one taken in
a pound net that weighed seventy-two pounds.
The late Dr. Elisha Sterling, formerly of Cleveland.
Ohio, a contemporary of Judge Potter and
the late Dr. Garlick, the father of artificial fish-culture
in America, told me of one he once
speared in Lake Erie that weighed eighty
pounds, and said that those of fifty to sixty
pounds were common in the forties.</p>

<p>The mascalonge is the best game-fish of its
family. When of large size, from twenty to
thirty pounds, it exhibits a bull-like ferocity when
hooked, making furious dashes for liberty, and if
not stopped in time will eventually take to the
weeds. It exhibits great powers of endurance,
but little finesse or cunning in its efforts to
escape. It depends on main strength alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
swimming swiftly in straight lines, as might be
inferred from its shape. Its long body does not
admit of the quick doublings of the black-bass or
brook-trout. If kept on the surface with a taut
line it sometimes leaps into the air; but if allowed
its own sweet will it bores toward the bottom, or
endeavors to reach the refuge of weeds or rushes.
One of less weight than twelve pounds, when
hooked, can scarcely be distinguished from the
pike or pickerel in its manner of resistance, and
exhibits but little more gameness.</p>

<p>A black-bass rod of eight or nine ounces is sufficient
for the largest mascalonge one is likely to
encounter in these days. I caught one on the
St. Lawrence, many years ago, that weighed
thirty-two pounds, on an eight-ounce Henshall
rod, and gaffed it in twenty minutes. Others
have done the same even with a lighter rod. But
it must be remembered that the weight of the
fish, added to his fierce lunges, is very trying to a
light rod, and I should not recommend one of less
weight than eight ounces, which will answer for
all emergencies in skilled hands. A good multiplying
reel, a braided silk or linen line, size E or
F, and Sproat or O'Shaughnessy hooks Nos. 3-0
to 5-0 on gimp snells, with brass box-swivel for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
connecting snell and line, constitute the rest of the
tackle.</p>

<p>The best season for mascalonge fishing is in
May or June, and in September and October, the
latter months preferable. The most favorable
hours are in the early morning and late afternoon.
The middle of the day may be fished with
a better prospect of success on cloudy, lowering
days, with a brisk wind.</p>

<p>The best bait is a large minnow, either alive
or dead, though a frog answers very well; and
in the absence of either, a trolling-spoon, No. 4,
with a single hook, may be utilized for casting.
Rowing along in water from five to ten feet
deep, the bait should be cast as far as possible
to the edge of weed patches, reeling it again
very slowly, or if the bait is alive it may be
allowed to swim outside of the water-plants for
a short time. By moving along continuously,
and making frequent casts, this method is much
more successful than still-fishing. When the
wind is just right, or when the current is strong
enough and the wind not contrary, it is a good
plan to allow the boat to drift while casting.</p>

<p>As soon as a fish is struck and hooked the
boat should be moved to deeper and open water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
at once, in order to give free play to the fish and
lessen the probability of its taking to the weeds.
In open water the angler has a better chance
successfully to play and land his quarry, which
should be kept on the surface as much as possible.
He can be aided very much in his efforts
by the careful and judicious management of the
boat by a <ins class="correction" title="text was 'skilful'">skillful</ins>  oarsman.</p>

<p>When the mascalonge shows signs of weakness
and can be drawn alongside, it should be gaffed
at once. Not by striking at it with quick and
violent motions, which serve only to frighten
the fish and endanger the angler's tackle, but the
gaff should be kept below the fish until it can
be drawn over it, and then by raising it slowly
and cautiously, until near enough, when, by a
quick upward and drawing motion, the point of
the hook should be driven into the throat or
breast of the fish, and by the same motion the
fish should be lifted into the boat. It should then
be killed by a smart stroke on the head, as a
wound from its sharp teeth is no trifling matter.
In the absence of a gaff-hook the fish should be
more thoroughly exhausted before bringing it
alongside the boat, when it should be struck a
stunning blow on the head before being taken in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The bait or spoon may be trolled along the
edges of the channel, just outside of the weed
patches, from a moving boat, with a line of thirty
to fifty yards. In trolling, the revolving spoon,
glistening and shining, is the attractive lure, and
any addition of a minnow, or strip of fish or pork-rind,
or other bait, as is often resorted to by some,
is entirely unnecessary. It adds nothing to the
chances of hooking a fish, and should never be
practised by the consistent angler. He may
use pork-rind if he wishes, but let it be used
alone, on its own merits. A spoon is bad enough
in any case, but it only makes it more reprehensible
and repulsive, to the angler at least, to
handicap it with bait of any kind; even the
bunch of feathers that usually adorns the spoon
should be discarded, as it is of no practical use.</p>

<p>Most mascalonge are taken, I am sorry to say,
by trolling with a hand-line of heavy braided
linen, size B or C, and a spoon of very large
size, as large as No. 8, which seems to be the
favorite size with hand-trollers. In this method
of fishing the mascalonge hooks himself when he
strikes the spoon. It is then drawn in, hand
over hand, as the sailors say, with might and
muscle. And as might be supposed, those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
practise this method are loudest in their praise
of the mascalonge as the "king of all game-fishes."
A quick pull, a strong pull, and a pull
all together, with the hauling aboard as soon as
possible of the struggling fish, amidst much
splashing and floundering, seems to be their
estimation of gameness in a fish.</p>

<p>The foregoing remarks apply to fishing on
lakes and quiet, weedy streams of the Northern
states. In the clear and swifter waters of the
upper Ohio, and its tributaries, the mascalonge
lies in the deep pools during summer and fall,
where it is taken by still-fishing. A large sucker,
weighing from half a pound to a pound, is the
favorite bait, with suitable rod and reel. The
fish is given plenty of time to gorge the bait
before striking, and this is quite important with
so large a bait. Many large mascalonge, there
called "pike," have been taken in this manner
in those waters, events to be long remembered
and talked about, while the head is carefully preserved
for the admiration and envy of future
generations of anglers.</p>

<p>Once when returning from a fishing trip to
northern Wisconsin when mascalonge were much
more in evidence than at the present day, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
carrying the head of a forty-pounder that just
filled an ordinary tin bucket. At Appleton,
while waiting for the train to Green Bay, the
big head was the centre of an admiring group
of anglers. Then came the natural and inevitable
query, "Where did you catch it?" In order to
avoid a long recital, which only could have done
justice to the subject, and expecting the train at
any moment, I replied, "An Indian speared it on
Lake St. Germain." They looked at me as if I
had seven heads; then one said: "Well! well! It
requires an awful lot of moral courage to make
such an admission." But I killed it, all the
same, on a nine-ounce rod, and my Indian canoeman
gaffed it.</p>


<h3>THE PIKE</h3>

<h4>(<i>Esox lucius</i>)</h4>

<p>The pike is more generally known in the
United States as "pickerel," and sometimes as
the great northern pickerel to distinguish it from
the pickerel, properly so-called. In England the
young pike is a pickerel, an older one a jack,
and the mature fish a pike. In England and
continental Europe the pike (<i>E. lucius</i>) is the
only species of the family inhabiting their
waters, while there are five species of the family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in America, which makes it all the more confusing
when the name "pickerel" is applied indiscriminately
to all,&mdash;even the mascalonge being
sometimes alluded to as an "overgrown pickerel."</p>

<p>The range of the pike in America is from
Lake Champlain, the Great Lake region, and
the upper Mississippi River, north to Alaska;
it is rare in the Ohio Valley.</p>

<p>Next to the mascalonge the pike is the most
important and largest member of the pike
family. It has a long body, somewhat compressed,
its length being a little more than
five times its depth. The head is large, somewhat
more than a fourth of the length of the
body, with a long, flattened, and projecting
snout; the teeth are similar, but not quite so
large or numerous as in the mascalonge.</p>

<p>The coloration and markings of the pike are
quite constant, not varying so much as in others
of the family, and is very different from those
of the mascalonge or any of the pickerels. The
ground color is grayish or greenish gray, darker
on the back and fading to silvery white on the
belly; the sides, from head to tail, are profusely
covered with irregular, oblong, or bean-shaped
whitish spots or blotches, much lighter than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
ground color; the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins
are marked with dark spots or blotches. It
is somewhat more gregarious, and is more of a
rover than the mascalonge; otherwise its habits
are very similar, and it coexists with that fish
in many waters, especially in the region of the
Great Lakes. It feeds on fish, frogs, and water-snakes.
Its usual weight reaches fifteen pounds,
though it occasionally grows to four feet in
length and a weight of twenty-five or thirty
pounds.</p>

<p>As a food-fish it is variously estimated. Some
consider it to be very good, and it sells well in
the markets,&mdash;which, however, is not always a
fair criterion. It is much better in the fall and
winter than in summer. Most people who
know it best, and I agree with them, think it
inferior to any fresh-water fish for the table
except the carp and sucker. Its flesh is soft
and dry, and unless of large size is not flaky,
and it is, moreover, very full of small bones.
One of ten pounds, stuffed with a savory dressing
and baked, is not unpalatable, but cannot
be compared favorably with the whitefish, black-bass,
or trout.</p>

<p>The pike when of large size is a good game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>fish.
Its weight and strength, added to its
bold rushes when hooked, are very trying to
light tackle. One of fifteen pounds is worthy
of the angler's most serious attention on an
eight-ounce rod. Its manner of fighting is similar
to that of the mascalonge, though in a lesser
degree, and it does not continue its resistance
so long. After a few frantic rushes it weakens
very materially, and if kept away from weeds
soon gives up the struggle for freedom.</p>

<p>In England, where game-fishes are much
scarcer than in this country, the pike is considered
a fine game-fish and is much sought
after by bait-fishers, and with a wonderful array
of murderous traces, minnow-gangs, and spinning
tackle. In the United States, where there are
so many better game-fishes, it is not often made
the object of special pursuit. Most pike are
caught by anglers in northern waters when
fishing for black-bass.</p>

<p>Ordinary black-bass rods and tackle are very
suitable for pike fishing, though where they
run large, eight to fifteen pounds, an eight or
nine-ounce rod is to be preferred to a lighter
one. A good multiplying reel, a braided line,
either silk or linen, size F, and Sproat hooks,
Nos. 2-0 to 3-0, are better suited to large pike than black-bass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>A minnow, or a trolling-spoon of small size
with a single Sproat or O'Shaughnessy hook,
may be employed in casting from a boat along
the edges of weed patches, lily-pads, and wild
rice, and along the shoals and bars. The same
tackle can be utilized for trolling in the same
situations. Where the conditions are favorable
it is advisable to allow the boat to drift, in order
to dispense with the noise and confusion of
rowing or paddling. The directions already
given for black-bass fishing, as to playing and
landing the fish, will answer just as well for the
pike.</p>

<p>As the pike seems to suggest the trolling-spoon,
this is a good place to say a few words concerning
that little-understood article of fishing
tackle. In the first place, it should never have
more than a <i>single</i> hook, and that should never
be handicapped by adding a minnow, frog, or
strip of fish or bacon-skin, as is so often done.
The hook should be left free to perform its
function, untrammelled by extraneous and useless
appendages. If the angler pins his faith to them,
by all means give them a fair chance on a hook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
without a spoon; it is not only more logical, but
more sportsmanlike. Give the fish a chance,
also, and of two evils let it choose the least by
using them separately. Seriously, the spoon is
a most alluring and attractive bait in itself. Its
bright and shining appearance when spinning
and glancing through the water is well-nigh
irresistible to a predaceous fish, and is in itself
all that could be desired as an effective lure.</p>

<p>The original trolling-spoon (made by Buell)
was the bowl of a dessert spoon, with a hole in
the broadest end for the line, and a single hook
soldered to the narrow end. It is as effective
as the best trolling-spoon made today. With a
single hook, either loosely attached or soldered
to the spoon, one is more apt to hook his fish,
and more certain of landing it, to say nothing
of the cruel and inhuman practice of using the
triangle of three hooks usually attached to most
trolling-spoons.</p>

<p>Manufacturers generally affix a triangle of
hooks to trolling-spoons, disguised by a bunch
of red and white feathers that are worse than
useless. The spoon is made of many shapes and
of various sizes, and often of two or three spoons
combined. They seem to vie with each other as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to who can turn out the most ridiculous contrivance,
for the farther it departs from the original
spoon the more useless it becomes. Manufacturers
are not all anglers, and endeavor to produce
what is most novel and attractive to the prospective
customer. Such appliances sell to the
uninitiated and unwary, but do not catch many
fish, or even anglers of experience.</p>

<p>And the same remarks will apply in a measure
to the gang or trace of several hooks, usually
employed in trolling or spinning the minnow.
A minnow, hooked through the lips&mdash;and it
may be a dead one&mdash;with a single hook, will
move more lifelike, and be really more attractive
to the fish, than the whirling, wabbling one, bristling
with a dozen hooks. It is cruel and heartless
to employ so murderous a device. I have seen
the mouths of bass and pike and lake-trout
lacerated and mutilated, sometimes the lips and
upper jaw torn completely off, by the triangle of
the spoon or the half dozen or more hooks of the
gang or trace. If their use cannot be dispensed
with on the score of inutility, a single hook being
far more successful, their employment should be
relinquished in the name of humanity.</p>

<p>The pike will not often rise to the artificial fly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
but will take it if allowed to sink a foot or two
after casting. Many years ago, in Wisconsin, I
devised the "polka" black-bass fly, and on its
first trial, at the very first cast, it was seized by a
pike of six pounds. The polka has a body of red
floss silk, with spotted wings of the guinea fowl.
I have frequently taken the pike with other red-bodied
flies, as the Abbey, red ibis, king of the
water, and Montreal, but the polka was always
the favorite. Flies with bodies of peacock harl,
as coachman, Henshall, Governor Alvord, etc.,
are very useful, as well as some with yellow
bodies, as professor, queen of the water, and
Lord Baltimore. The afternoon hours, especially
toward sundown and until dusk, are the most
promising for fly-fishing. Large flies are also
successfully used in trolling for pike, from a
rather slow-moving boat. For fuller instructions
for fly-fishing the reader is referred to those
given for the black-bass, which will answer very
well for the pike, especially where the two fishes
inhabit the same waters.</p>

<p>Fishing through the ice for pike or pickerel
has quite a fascination for some persons, even for
those who never fish in any other way. And
there is a certain kind of enjoyment in it, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
actual fishing, as we understand it, has but little
to do with it. If the ice is glare and free of snow,
one can vary the amusement with skating. The
bracing, nipping air on a clear day, with the sun
shining brightly on the winter landscape, has its
charms, and fishing through the ice is a good
pretext for a winter outing. A dozen or more
holes are cut through the ice in a circle, its
diameter extending over the feeding grounds of
the pike, whether small or great in extent. A fire
may be built in the centre, if far from the shore
on a lake, or on the shore itself if convenient to
the holes. The holes being cut and a fire made
for comfort, the next thing to do is to place the
"tip-ups," as they are called, and bait the hooks,
when there is nothing more to be done but to fill
one's pipe and wait by the fire for the anticipated
event&mdash;the rising of a signal proclaiming a "bite."</p>

<p>Tip-ups are made in several ways, but the
simplest plan, which is as good as any, is to
provide a piece of thin board, say two or three
feet long and two or three inches wide. A few
inches from one end a hole is bored, through
which is thrust a round stick, like a section of a
broom-handle, and long enough to extend well
across the hole in the ice. A short line, usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
three or four feet long, with suitable hook and
sinker, is tied to the short end of the thin board,
through a small hole bored for the purpose. The
hook is then baited, placed in the water, and
the thin board is laid down on its edge, with
the short end at the middle of the hole in the
ice, and the round stick straddling it. It will be
readily understood that a fish pulling on the line
at the short end of the thin board, or lever, will
raise the long end, thus indicating to the watcher
the looked-for event. The long end of the lever
may be shaved to a point, to which a signal flag
may be affixed. Where the fish are plentiful it
will keep one pretty busy running from one hole
to another to take off the pike or rebait the
hooks.</p>

<p>When residing at Oconomowoc, Wisconsin.
I found that fishing through the ice for pike and
yellow-perch was a favorite sport. I indulged in
it once for pike and several times for perch, for
the latter is a firm, sweet, and delicious pan-fish
in the winter. Driving over La Belle Lake in
my sleigh to the "pickerel grounds," where my
man had cut the holes the day before, the tip-ups
and lines were soon arranged and the hooks
baited with live minnows. A fire was then built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
on the shore, near at hand, to warm the chilled
fingers. It was pretty tame when considered
from the angler's point of view; but with the
keen, crisp winter air, and the bright sun sparkling
on the pure white snow, on which I occasionally
took a spin in the sleigh, it was quite
an enjoyable experience. In the course of a few
hours several pike were taken and left lying
on the snow, where they soon became frozen
stiff. Upon my arrival at home they were
placed in a tub of cold water, when all but one
or two revived and began to swim about; the
latter were probably too thoroughly frozen or
may have been dead before being frozen. Apropos
of this: I had some minnows in a live box, at
the edge of the lake near my home, that thawed
out alive in the spring after being frozen all
winter. They were evidently the same minnows,
as there were no dead ones, and the live ones
could hardly have got into the box from the lake.</p>

<p>The mediocrity of the pike as a game-fish is
doubtless a just estimation in a majority of cases,
but once in a while one will exhibit game qualities
that will surprise the most doubting and contemptuous
angler, compelling his admiration, and
forcing him to admit that there are exceptions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to all rules, but more especially in fishing. I was
once one of a party of black-bass fishers on a lake
in Wisconsin. In one of the boats was a lady of
Milwaukee, who was justly considered one of the
most expert and level-headed anglers in the party.
She always stood up in her boat, was a marvel in
casting the minnow, and played a bass to a finish
in a style both graceful and artistic after a short,
sharp, and decisive contest. She used the lightest
rods and tackle, and the best. On this occasion,
after landing a number of gamy bass and
logy pike, she hooked a pike of about six pounds
that put her six-ounce rod to the severest test,
and gave her twenty minutes of the liveliest
work that a fish is capable of. It leaped repeatedly
from the water, and rushed not only straight
away, but twisted and turned and doubled in a
manner that would have done credit to the gamest
bass. Finally she brought it to the landing-net
in triumph, though she was, to use her own
expression, "completely tuckered out." I venture
to say that no man of the party would have been
successful in landing that pike, with the same
tackle, in the same length of time.</p>

<p>A woman who is an expert angler will risk
her tackle to greater lengths than a man, and will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
take more chances in subduing a fish within a
reasonable time. This is not because of recklessness,
or because she does not understand or
appreciate the tensile strength of her rod. On
the contrary, she knows her tackle well, and has
the utmost faith in its potentiality. I knew a
lady friend who was never more than thirty minutes
in bringing to gaff any salmon of from
twenty-five to thirty pounds. And my Kentucky
friend, Mrs. Bachmann (formerly Mrs. Stagg),
killed her tarpon of two hundred and five pounds
in eighty minutes.</p>


<h3>THE EASTERN PICKEREL</h3>

<h4>(<i>Esox reticulatus</i>)</h4>

<p>The eastern pickerel, also called chain pickerel
in the North, and jack in the South, was first
described by Le Sueur, in 1818, from the Connecticut
River. He named it <i>reticulatus</i>, owing
to the "reticulations" or the netted character of
the markings on the body.</p>

<p>Its range extends from Maine along the coastwise
streams to Florida and Louisiana. West of
the Alleghanies it has been reported from the
Ozark region of Missouri and Arkansas, but I am
rather inclined to doubt it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>In its general form the pickerel resembles a
small pike, though it is more slender, has a larger
eye, and its coloration is quite different. The
ground color is either olive-brown or some shade
of green, the sides with a golden lustre, and the
belly white. The sides are marked with many
dark lines and streaks, mostly oblique and horizontal,
forming a kind of network. There is a
dark vertical bar below the eye; the dorsal fin is
plain; the lower fins sometimes reddish; the
caudal fin occasionally has a few dark spots or
blotches.</p>

<p>In its habits of feeding and spawning it is
similar to the pike, spawning in the early spring.
It is found in weedy ponds in the North, and in the
quiet, grassy reaches of southern streams. It feeds
mostly on small fishes and frogs. It grows to a
foot in length, usually, sometimes to two feet and
weighing seven or eight pounds, though its usual
maximum weight is three or four pounds.</p>

<p>In the New England states it is regarded by
many as not only a fine game-fish, but an excellent
food-fish as well. Others despise it on both
counts, and there you are. To many a Yankee
boy fishing for pickerel was the highest ideal of
angling, but with the larger experience of mature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
years his idol has been thrown from its pedestal,
and he, too, has learned to look askance at the
friend of his youth. But while the pickerel is not
a game-fish of high degree, it is capable of furnishing
a fair amount of sport with light black-bass
tackle in waters not too weedy.</p>

<p>Ordinary black-bass rods and tackle are quite
suitable for pickerel fishing, either with bait or
fly, though the hooks should be larger, about 1-0
to 2-0, on gimp snells or heavy silkworm fibre.
Where the weeds are too thick to admit of playing
the fish a reel can be dispensed with, and a
plain, light bamboo or cane rod, in its natural
state, can be substituted for the jointed rod. It
should be long enough to furnish considerable
elasticity, say twelve feet, as its flexibility must
subserve, somewhat, the purposes of a reel.</p>

<p>The pickerel will take a sunken fly in shallow
water, after it has been fluttered on the surface
awhile. The red ibis, soldier, Abbey, polka.
Montreal, and coachman are all good pickerel
flies, if cast toward the dusk of evening.</p>

<p>Skittering is a favorite method of fishing for
the pickerel in weedy ponds. It is practised with
a long cane rod, and line of about the same length
as the rod, with or without a reel. A spoon bait,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
frog, or a piece of white bacon-rind cut in the
semblance of a fish, or a frog's hind legs, skinned,
are skittered or fluttered on the surface near the
lily-pads and pickerel weeds. The fish should be
kept on the surface if possible, when hooked, and
drawn into open water; otherwise it may become
entangled in the weeds and lost.</p>

<p>The pickerel may also be taken by still-fishing
from a boat with the live minnow or frog. On
open water, a very successful way is trolling with
a small spoon and single hook, or a dead minnow.
For these methods the reader is referred to pike
or black-bass fishing on previous pages.</p>

<p>I have found the pickerel as far south as eastern
Florida, where it is known as "pike," though
it is rarely met with, and owing to its rarity is
held in pretty fair esteem as a game-fish. In the
marshes and rice ditches of South Carolina, and
some sluggish streams of southeast Georgia, it is
rather more plentiful, though usually of inferior
size and dusky coloration. I once caught several
on the Cooper River in South Carolina when
fishing with very light tackle for "bream," which
were unusually active and strong, and which impressed
me as entitled to a better reputation as
a game-fish than is commonly accorded to it by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
anglers. On the whole, the eastern pickerel is
not half a bad fish, as English anglers would say.
One might go farther and fare worse.</p>


<h3>THE WESTERN PICKEREL</h3>

<h4>(<i>Esox vermiculatus</i>)</h4>

<p>The western pickerel was first described by
Le Sueur from the Wabash River. He named
it <i>vermiculatus</i>, owing to the "wormlike" appearance
of its markings. He collected it about
1818, but his description was not published until
1846. It inhabits the Mississippi Valley, south to
Arkansas and Mississippi, and the tributaries of
Lakes Erie and Michigan. It is not found east
of the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>It is formed on the same general lines as the
other members of the pike family, but is rather
more slender and rounder, with a shorter head,
proportionally, but a larger eye. Its color is
olive-green, or grayish green, darker on the back,
and belly white. The sides are covered with
many dark curved streaks, inextricably mixed,
or forming reticulations. The coloration is quite
variable in different waters. A dark vertical bar
is usually present below the eye; the sides of the
head are variegated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>It is common in the grassy streams of the
Middle West and weedy bayous of the Southwest,
never exceeding a foot in length. The
late Dr. Elisha Sterling, of Cleveland, Ohio, once
sent me a plaster cast of one not more than eight
inches in length, with the ovaries exposed, showing
the ripe ova. It is not of much importance
as a game-fish or as a food-fish. It spawns in
early spring, and feeds on small fish, frogs, and
tadpoles. It may be fished for in the same way,
and with the same tackle as recommended for
crappies on a previous page.</p>


<h3>THE BANDED PICKEREL</h3>

<h4>(<i>Esox americanus</i>)</h4>

<p>The banded pickerel, Long Island pickerel, or
brook pickerel, as it is variously known, was one
of the first of its family to be recognized. It was
described by Gmelin, in 1788, from Long Island.
New York. He named it <i>americanus</i>, or "American
pike," as a variety of the European <i>Esox
lucius</i>.</p>

<p>It is found only east of the Alleghanies in
coastwise streams from Massachusetts to Florida.
It is almost a duplicate of the little western pickerel
in its general form, and represents that species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
in eastern waters. The characteristics of fin rays,
scales, and squamation of cheeks and gill-covers
apply equally to both species.</p>

<p>The ground color is dark green; belly white;
sides with about twenty distinct, blackish, curved,
vertical bars, often obscurely marked, but not
distinctly reticulated. There is a black vertical
bar below the eye, and a horizontal band extending
from the snout, through the eye, to the gill-cover.
The lower fins are often quite red. I
have collected it on the east coast of Florida of a
beautiful emerald-green coloration, without distinct
dark markings, and with orange-colored
lower fins&mdash;a most beautiful fish.</p>

<p>Although an interesting little fish, it is of no
importance to anglers and is merely mentioned
here, with the little western pickerel, to enable
the reader to identify the different members of
the pike family. It spawns early in the spring.
It seldom grows beyond a foot in length, and is
usually much smaller. Fishing for it is on the
same plane with sunfishing, and the lightest
tackle should be employed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PERCH FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Percidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>Most of the species belonging to this family
are the dwarf perches, the beautiful little darters
of the clear streams. The only genera of importance
as game-fishes are <i>Stizostedion</i>, the pike-perches,
and <i>Perca</i>, the yellow-perch. They are
characterized by an elongate, nearly round body;
small, rough, and adherent scales; rather large
mouth with sharp teeth; spines on opercle, and
preopercle serrate; branchiostegals six or seven;
two dorsal fins, the first composed of spines,
the second of soft rays; the anal fin with two
spines.</p>


<h4>GENUS STIZOSTEDION</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stizostedion vitreum.</i> The Pike-perch. Body elongate; back somewhat
elevated; head 4; depth 5; eye 4; D. XIV-20; A. II,
12; scales 10-125-25; head and cheeks sparsely scaled; canine
teeth on jaws and palatines; opercle with small spines; pyloric
c&oelig;ca 3.</p>

<p><i>Stizostedion canadense.</i> The Sauger. Body elongate and spindle-shaped;
head 3-1/2; depth 4-1/2; eye 5; D. XIII-18; A. II, 12;</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><p>scales 9-100-27; head and cheeks scaly; spines on opercle;
head depressed and pointed; pyloric c&oelig;ca 5 to 7.</p></blockquote>


<h4>GENUS PERCA</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Perca flavescens.</i> The Yellow-perch. Body oblong, somewhat
compressed, the back elevated; head 3-1/4; depth 3-1/4; eye 5; D.
XIV-15; A. II, 7; scales 6-75-17; top of head rough; profile
convex from dorsal to occiput, thence concave to snout, which
projects; cheeks scaly; opercles nearly naked; preopercle and
shoulder girdle serrated; teeth in villiform bands; branchiostegals
7; scales strongly ctenoid.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE PIKE-PERCH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Stizostedion vitreum</i>)</h4>

<p>The pike-perch or wall-eye was first described
by Dr. Mitchill in 1818, from Cayuga Lake, New
York. He named it <i>vitrea</i> in allusion to its large
vitreous or glassy eye. It would have been indeed
fortunate if the name glass-eye or wall-eye, with or
without the suffix perch, had been adopted; for
this fine fish is a true perch, with nothing "pike-like"
in form or habits, except its large mouth
and canine teeth, and nothing "salmon-like"
except its trimly-shaped body. But these fancied
resemblances have caused it to be called in various
localities wall-eyed pike, yellow pike, blue
pike, glass-eyed pike, salmon, and jack salmon.
It is also known in Canada as dorè and okow,
and among the commercial fishermen as "pick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>erel."
However, the names pike-perch and wall-eyed
pike have been rather universally adopted,
and it will probably be always known by these
names. Pike-perch is the Anglicized form of
<i>Lucioperca</i>, the Latin name of the genus in
Europe.</p>

<p>It is abundant in Canada and the Great Lake
region, and fairly abundant in the upper Mississippi
River and its tributaries, and especially in
Lake Pepin. It is found also in the lake region
of northern Minnesota, and in the lakes and
streams of Wisconsin and Iowa. It is not uncommon
in the upper Ohio River and tributaries,
south to Tennessee. On the Atlantic slope it is
more rarely found from Pennsylvania to Georgia,
where it often exists in brackish water. I have
taken it in my boyhood days at Ferry Bar, a
point on the Patapsco River, near Baltimore.
Maryland. Its range is being constantly extended
by transplantation. The pike-perch is a
very trimly-built and shapely fish. Its body is
rather slender, not much compressed. The head
is well shaped, neither too large nor too small,
with a large mouth well filled with teeth, some
quite long and sharp. The eye is very large and
glassy. Like all the perches it has two dorsal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
fins, well separated; the caudal fin is forked.
The scales are small and rough. The edge of
the cheek-bone is toothed or serrated, and the
edge of the gill-cover has one or more small
spines. The color varies considerably in different
localities, and even in the same waters. The
usual color is olive, or greenish brown, mottled
with brassy or yellowish blotches forming oblique
but indistinct lines, or vermicular markings. The
head is similarly colored and marked; the lower
jaw is reddish; the belly and lower fins pinkish
or yellowish; the first dorsal fin is not much
marked, but has a large black blotch on its posterior
border; the second dorsal fin is mottled
with olive, brown, and yellow; the caudal fin is
likewise mottled, with the tip of the lower lobe
white or light colored.</p>

<p>The pike-perch frequents waters of good depth,
only entering the shallow portions of streams and
lakes at spawning time, and at night when feeding.
It prefers a bottom of rock or gravel in
clear and cool water, and loves to lie in the deep
pools at the foot of riffles, or at the entrance of
streams; or where the current is strong and deep
near mill-dams and under sunken logs, or shelving
rocks and banks, and about the timbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
bridges in deep water. It is nocturnal in its
habits, for which it is well fitted by its large and
prominent eye, and seeks its prey, which consists
mostly of small fishes, in shallow water.</p>

<p>It spawns in the spring, and in lakes usually
resorts to its spawning grounds in the winter,
where it is caught through the ice in large numbers
in certain localities, notably in Put-in-Bay on
Lake Erie, and in Lake Pepin and other northern
lakes. It spawns in sand or gravel in shallow
water. Its eggs are small, twelve to an inch, and
average fifty thousand to a female. After spawning
it retires to deeper water, and in summer locates
in the deepest pools. During the spring freshets
it sometimes ascends smaller streams in its search
for food. Its usual weight does not exceed three
or four pounds, though it often grows much larger,
from ten to twenty pounds. I have seen preserved
heads of fish that must have weighed thirty or
forty pounds, which had been caught in Kentucky&mdash;in
Tygert Creek and Kentucky River. It is
highly prized as a food-fish, its flesh being white,
firm, and flaky, and of an excellent flavor. It is
a commercial fish of much importance, especially
on Lake Erie, from whence it is shipped in large
numbers to the city markets, where it always com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>mands
a ready sale, being in great demand during
the Lenten season.</p>

<p>The pike-perch is a good game-fish, taking live
bait eagerly, and rising pretty well to the fly.
When hooked it is a vigorous fighter, pulling
strongly and lustily. It does not exhibit much
dash or take line rapidly, but swims away rather
slowly, but at the same time is constantly tugging
and jerking on the line in such a manner as to
require careful handling with light tackle. Ordinary
black-bass rods and tackle are well suited
for the pike-perch up to six or eight pounds, either
for bait-fishing or fly-fishing. Where they are
found in considerable numbers, and especially on
lakes where pickerel or pike abound, gimp snells
should be used instead of gut snells to withstand
their sharp teeth; otherwise the tackle may be
the same as recommended for black-bass fishing.
The best bait is a live minnow, though crawfish
are successfully used. On lakes it should be fished
for in comparatively deep water, over pebbly or
rocky bottom. On streams the likely places are
in deep and swift water, at the foot of rapids, or
on a rocky lee shore with a brisk wind, where it
congregates in search of minnows that are rendered
almost helpless by the churning water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to its nocturnal habits, the hours from
about sunset until dark are the most favorable.
Night fishing is also quite successful should any
one care for it. As a matter of experiment I
fished Pewaukee Lake, in Wisconsin, one moonlit
evening in summer, many years ago, in company
with three other anglers, there being two to
a boat. In a few hours twenty-two were landed
to each boat, weighing from three to four pounds
each. This was my only experience in fishing
for pike-perch at night, but I have known many
others to practise it very successfully.</p>

<p>Fly-fishing is most successful from about sundown
until dark, or later, and on cloudy days also
during the afternoon. Two flies on a four-foot
leader may be used, one of which should be a
light-colored one, as the coachman, or white
miller; the other may be any of the hackles or the
stone fly, oriole, gray drake, polka, professor, or
Montreal. The same instructions concerning fly-fishing
for black-bass may be profitably followed
for the pike-perch, allowing the flies to sink two
or three feet after each cast, though it is a more
uncertain fish to locate, being much given to
roaming in its search for food at different
seasons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Years ago I had fine sport on several occasions,
about sundown, fly-fishing for pike-perch
from the bridge over Neenah channel, the outlet
of Lake Winnebago, in Wisconsin. It was really
the best fishing I have ever had for this fish.
All the conditions seemed to be just right, and
they responded eagerly to the coachman and
oriole at first, but at the approach of dusk they
preferred the dusty miller and gray hackle. The
fish averaged three pounds, and in the swift
water were quite gamy. I have been very
successful, on many occasions, fly-fishing on the
Muskingum River, in Ohio, fishing just below
the dams late in the afternoon; and also about
the rocky tow-heads on the upper Ohio River,&mdash;the
fish, however, averaging only about a pound.
But taking everything into consideration, the
character of the stream and its surroundings, I
think I have had the most enjoyable experience
with the pike-perch, both in fly-fishing and bait-fishing,
on Rock River, Wisconsin, in the southern
part of the state. It is a beautiful, rocky
river in places, an ideal stream for wading. The
fish also were of good size, running up to five or
six pounds.</p>

<p>In fishing for pike-perch in different parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the country I have noticed its variableness of
coloration, which might be inferred from some
of its names, as gray pike, yellow pike, blue pike,
white salmon, etc. As I remember them, those
caught in brackish water in Maryland were quite
greenish, with silvery reflections and with dark
markings. On Lake Erie the coloration varies
somewhat with age, the younger ones being
known as blue pike, the mature fish as yellow
pike, and the oldest and largest as gray pike.
On the rivers of the Middle West that are subject
to periods of high and muddy water they are
much paler. On the many pine-fringed lakes in
northern Wisconsin and Minnesota the variation
in color is quite apparent, both as to the ground
color and markings. The older fish are very
dark and dull on the back, and the younger ones
much brighter.</p>


<h3>THE SAUGER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Stizostedion canadense</i>)</h4>

<p>The sauger was first described by C. H. Smith,
in 1834, who named it <i>canadensis</i>, from having
collected his type specimens in Canada.</p>

<p>It is also known as jack, sand-pike, gray-pike,
and rattlesnake pike. It is closely related to the
pike-perch, though smaller and more slender, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a more pointed head and smaller eye. It is distributed
through the Great Lake region and in
the upper portions of the Missouri, Mississippi,
and Ohio rivers. It grows to a length of twelve
to fifteen inches. Its color is paler than the pike-perch,
grayish above, with brassy sides, which are
marked by several blackish blotches or patches,
hence "rattlesnake pike."</p>

<p>It is not nearly so good a food-fish as the pike-perch,
and is not of much importance as a game-fish.
It may be fished for with the same tackle as
that recommended for the calico-bass or crappie, in
the same situations mentioned for the pike-perch.
I have taken it with a gaudy fly on the Ohio and
Muskingum rivers, in Ohio, and in the Big Sandy
and Tygert Creek, in Kentucky; also by still-fishing
and trolling on Lake Erie about the Bass
Islands. The meaning or etymology of the name
"sauger" is unknown.</p>


<h3>THE YELLOW-PERCH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Perca flavescens</i>)</h4>

<p>The yellow-perch was first described by Dr.
Mitchill in 1814, from the vicinity of New York.
He named it <i>flavescens</i>, "yellowish," owing to its
coloration. It is closely allied to the perch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Europe. It is commonly known as perch or
yellow-perch, also as ringed-perch and raccoon-perch.
It is abundant in the Great Lake region
and in coastwise streams of the Atlantic slope
from Nova Scotia to North Carolina. It is also
common in some of the tributaries of the upper
Mississippi River and in certain lakes in northern
Indiana. It is a handsome fish, well proportioned,
and of a lively disposition. It has a
shapely body, with a depth of about one-third of
its length, somewhat compressed, and with an
arching back. The mouth is moderate in size,
with bands of small, bristlelike teeth, but no canines,
and has a projecting snout. The head is
not quite one-third of the length of the body.
Its back is dark olive, sides bright golden yellow,
belly pale or pinkish, with half a dozen or more
broad, dark, vertical bars. The lower fins are
bright red or orange. While the coloration varies
somewhat in different situations it is always brilliant,
rendering it one of the handsomest fishes
among the fresh-water species.</p>

<p>The yellow-perch is gregarious, always in
schools, and the fish of a school will be about of
a uniform size, be that great or small. It frequents
waters of a moderate depth in streams or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
lakes or ponds. In streams, early in the spring,
it frequently resorts to the edge or foot of riffles,
when feeding, but later prefers the deeper water
under mill-dams and about the submerged timbers
of bridges, and the still water under hollow
banks, or in the eddies of old logs, rocks, etc. It
is averse to a muddy bottom in fresh water, but
along the eastern coast it is often found on the
weedy shoals of shallow bays in brackish water.
In my boyhood days it was a prime favorite with
myself and companions. We sought it on the
mud-flats, among the water-plants, of the Patapsco
River, near Baltimore. It was there known as
"yellow Ned," and was considered a good pan-fish.</p>

<p>In Lake Michigan, after leaving its winter
quarters in the spring, it fairly swarms about the
piers and wharves of Chicago and other towns,
where it is caught by thousands by men, women,
and children with hand-lines, rods, and dip-nets.
It is a very predaceous fish and feeds principally
on small minnows and the young of other fishes,
also on crawfish, tadpoles, small frogs, insects, etc.
In large waters it grows to a pound or two in
weight, sometimes more. Usually it is much
smaller, a half-pound perch being a good-sized
fish in most localities. In midsummer, in weedy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
ponds, it is not good; but at other seasons, or in
clear, cold water, it is an excellent pan-fish, firm
and flaky. In brackish water it is good at all
seasons. Whenever it has a muddy taste, it
should be skinned, by which the objectionable
flavor is removed almost entirely, and owing to
its adherent scales it is the best plan for dressing
it. It spawns early in the spring, in March and
April, though in very cold waters not until May.
The eggs are about twelve to the inch, and are
held together by a glutinous substance in long,
ribbonlike masses from two to six feet in length,
and from an inch to three or four inches wide.</p>

<p>Light trout tackle, either for bait-fishing or fly-fishing,
is suitable for the yellow-perch for those
anglers who can appreciate the pleasure to be
derived only by the use of appropriate and elegant
tackle for any kind of fishing, and a pound
perch is well worthy of such implements. With
a fly-rod of a few ounces, a light click reel, an
enamelled silk line, and a small leader and flies
on hooks No. 7, the yellow-perch will not disappoint
the most exacting angler who has a true
love for the sport. Under such circumstances it
is a good game-fish, eager to rise, bold to a degree,
and fights to a finish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the flies used for black-bass, as coachman,
polka, oriole, professor, Abbey, etc., are successful,
as well as the hackles of various shades,
and occasionally red ibis and stone fly. The late
afternoon hours are to be preferred for fly-fishing.
The flies should be allowed to sink with
each cast, after being fluttered on the surface a
few seconds.</p>

<p>In the absence of a more suitable rod, a light
one of native cane, nine or ten feet long, will do
good service without a reel. The line should be
the smallest "sea-grass," or twisted silk. Hooks
Nos. 5 or 6, on gut snells, with a small brass box-swivel
for connecting snell and line, make up the
rest of the tackle.</p>

<p>The most taking bait is a small minnow, but
grasshoppers, crickets, white grubs, or earthworms
are good. In tidal waters the shrimp is
preferred. But in the absence of any of these
baits, cut-bait, either fish or flesh, may be used
with good results, for the yellow-perch is not
very particular or fastidious. Large perch are
also easily taken by trolling with the minnow,
or a very small spoon on lakes or ponds. If
the spoon is employed, but a single hook should
be used, and that not too large. I am not an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
advocate, however, for trolling for so small a
fish, and merely mention it as one of the ways
and means that may be followed. There are
men who never rise above this method for any
game-fish, but they are more to be pitied than
blamed. They either lack the skill to practise
more approved methods, or are too indolent to
learn them.</p>

<p>The yellow-perch has been introduced into
some waters west of the Rockies. A few weighing
about a pound were sent to me from a lake
about forty miles west of Spokane, which were of
exceptionally bright coloration and good flavor.
In the same box were two pike of about four
pounds each, and a large-mouth black-bass of
eight pounds, dressed, and very fat, plump, and
delicious. These fish were the result of a single
plant by the United States Fish Commission
some years ago. On the Missouri River, a few
miles above the Great Falls, a large lake has been
formed by an expansion of the river, caused by
building a dam for an electric light plant. Several
years ago some yellow-perch were placed in this
lake, or in the river just above it, but by whom
I have not been able to ascertain. At all events,
the lake now swarms with perch, strings of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
hundred or more not being an uncommon catch
in a single day, as I am credibly informed. As
the water above the forks of the Missouri River
is too cold for the perch, and the water of the
lake too warm for trout or grayling, there seems
to be no probability of any harm resulting from
the introduction of the yellow-perch, though it
was not a wise thing to do. About the only fish
in that portion of the Missouri, before the perch
were planted just above the Great Falls, were
ling, suckers, and catfish.</p>

<p>In the many small lakes near Oconomowoc.
Wisconsin, the yellow-perch thrives well. It is
caught in the summer by men, women, and children
with almost any kind of bait, and often with
the rudest tackle. To the summer visitors it is
a source of perennial delight, and an unfailing
means of enjoyment to the juvenile anglers. In
my day, Genesee Lake, a few miles from Oconomowoc,
contained some of the largest perch of all
the numerous lakes and lakelets. In this lake
only the small-mouth bass and yellow-perch were
found, no large-mouth bass or pike, and the bass
and perch were of about the same size&mdash;two
pounds. This uniformity of weight did not
obtain in any of the other lakes. A basket of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
perch from Genesee Lake was a handsome sight,
and the fish were unusually sweet and savory.
During the winter the residents catch yellow-perch
through holes cut in the ice in great numbers,
in all of the lakes mentioned. It was here
that I devised my "Oconomowoc" bass fly with
creamy yellow body, hackle of hairs of deer's tail,
cinnamon (woodcock) wings, and tail of ginger;
but for the perch of Genesee I found that with
a tail of scarlet wool it was more effective.
Many a two-pound perch responded to that lure,
in days long gone, and as Thoreau says, "It is a
true fish, such as the angler loves to put into
his basket or hang on top of his willow twig on
shady afternoons."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE GRAYLING FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Thymallidæ</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Thymallus signifer.</i> Head 5-1/2; depth 4-2/3; eye 3; D. 24; A. II;
scales 8-88 to 90-11; c&oelig;ca 18; body elongate, compressed,
highest under the anterior portion of the dorsal; head rather
short, subconic, compressed, its upper outline continuous with
anterior curve of the back; mouth moderate, the maxillary extending
to below the middle of the eye; maxillary 6 (?) in
head; jaws about equal; tongue, in the young, with teeth,
which are usually absent in the adult; eye quite large, rather
longer than snout; scales moderate; lateral line nearly straight;
a small bare space behind isthmus; dorsal fin long and high,
about 3-1/2 in length of body; adipose fin small; anal fin small;

A. 10 or 11; scales 8-82 to 85-10; gill-rakers 5 + 12; maxillary
3 in head; dorsal fin 4-1/2 in length of body. Other features
much resembling <i>T. signifer</i> and <i>T. tricolor</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>Owing to the restricted area of its distribution,
the "graceful, gliding grayling" is known
to but comparatively few anglers in America.
He who has been so fortunate as to have this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
beautiful fish respond to his deftly cast flies, will
bear me out in the assertion that for courage,
finesse, and all the qualities that constitute a
true game-fish, the grayling is the equal of its congener,
the trout.</p>

<p>In France it is known as ombre, in Germany
as asche, and in Norway as harren. Among
all English-speaking people it is the grayling,
though occasionally it is called umber in parts
of England. All of these names are somewhat
descriptive of its grayish, ashy, or bluish coloration.
Gliding along in clear, swift water it
seems, indeed, a gray shadow; but fresh out
of its native element it becomes a creature of
mother-of-pearl, so beautiful and varied are its
tints.</p>

<p>The graceful outlines and beautifully-moulded
proportions of the grayling, together with the
satiny sheen and delicate coloration of her adornment,
have always impressed me as essentially
feminine. The evanescent play of prismatic
hues on her shapely and rounded sides, when
fresh from the pure and crystal stream she loves
so well, reminds one of changeable silk shot with
all the colors of the rainbow. Her tall dorsal
fin, with its rose-colored spots, she waves as
gracefully and effectually as the nodding plume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of a duchess.</p>
<div class="image" id="illo_214">
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_214.jpg">THE ARCTIC GRAYLING</a></p>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_214.jpg">THE MONTANA GRAYLING</a></p>
</div>

<p>The grayling was named by the ancients
<i>Thymallus</i>, owing to a smell of thyme that was
said to emanate from the fish when freshly
caught. However that may have been in days
of old, it is not so now, though an odor of
cucumbers is sometimes perceptible when it is
just out of the water. But the name, if not the
odor, has endured to the present day, for <i>Thymallus</i>
is still its generic appellation. The graylings
were formerly included in the salmon
family, and are still so considered by European
ichthyologists, who include them in the genus
<i>Salmo</i>. Dr. Theodore Gill, however, has formed
them into a separate family (<i>Thymallidæ</i>), owing
to the peculiar structure of the skull, whereby
the parietal bones meet at the median line,
excluding the frontal bones from the supra-occipital;
whereas in the other salmonids the
parietals are separated by the intervention of
the supra-occipital bone, which connects with
the frontals.</p>

<p>There are three species in America: one in
the Arctic regions, one in Michigan, and one
in Montana. To the untrained eye no great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
difference is apparent between these various
species as to form and coloration,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and their
habits are similar, all loving clear, cold, and swift
water, with gravelly or sandy bottom. They
feed on insects and their larvæ, small minnows,
crustaceans, and such small organisms. They
spawn in the spring. The eggs are smaller than
trout eggs, running seven to the inch. They
hatch in from ten days to two weeks, according
to temperature of the water.</p>


<h3>THE ARCTIC GRAYLING</h3>

<h4>(<i>Thymallus signifer</i>)</h4>

<p>The Arctic grayling was first described by
Sir John Richardson, in 1823, from specimens</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>collected at Winter Lake, near Fort Enterprise,
in British America. He named it <i>signifer</i>, or
"standard-bearer," in allusion to its tall, waving,
gayly-colored dorsal fin. It is presumably the
oldest and original species, and it is not unlikely
that it was transported to Michigan and Montana
on an ice-field during the glacial period.
It is often called Bach's grayling, in honor of
an officer of that name who took the first one
on the fly, when with the Arctic expedition of
Sir John Franklin, in 1819. It abounds in clear,
cold streams of the Mackenzie and Yukon provinces
in British America, and in Alaska up to
the Arctic Ocean. This boreal grayling has a
somewhat smaller head than the other species,
its upper outline being continuous with the
curve of the back. The mouth is small, extending
to below the middle of the eye, which latter
is larger than in the other graylings, while its
dorsal fin is both longer and higher, and contains
a few more rays. The sides are purplish gray,
darker on the back; head brownish, a blue
mark on each side of the lower jaw; the dorsal
fins dark gray, splashed with a lighter shade,
with rows of deep blue spots edged with red;
ventral fins with red and white stripes. Along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the sides are scattered a few irregularly-shaped
black spots.</p>

<p>A friend of mine, an ardent angler, returned
recently from Cape Nome and the Yukon, in
Alaska, where he resided for several years. He
informed me that the grayling is very abundant
in the streams of that region, and that he had
taken thousands on the fly; but not knowing
that they differed from the Montana grayling, he
did not examine them closely.</p>


<h3>THE MICHIGAN GRAYLING</h3>

<h4>(<i>Thymallus tricolor</i>)</h4>

<p>The Michigan grayling was first described by
Professor E. D. Cope, in 1865, from specimens
from the Au Sable River. He named it <i>tricolor</i>,
on account of its handsomely-decorated fins and
body. At that time it was abundant in the Au
Sable, Manistee, Marquette, Jordan, Pigeon, and
other rivers in the northern part of the lower peninsula
of Michigan, and in Otter Creek, near
Keweenah, in the upper peninsula. It has a somewhat
larger head than the Arctic form, its length
being about one-fifth of the length of the body;
the outline of the latter does not differ except
in not being so prominent over the shoulder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p>The coloration is purplish gray with silvery
reflections, darker on the back, belly white and
iridescent; sides of head with bright bluish and
bronze lustre; sides of the body with small,
black, irregular spots; ventral fins with oblique,
rose-colored lines; dorsal with alternate dusky
and rose-colored lines below, and alternate rows
of dusky green and roseate spots above; caudal
fin dusky with a middle roseate stripe.</p>

<p>In 1870-1876 I visited most of the grayling
streams in Michigan, and found it abundant,
affording fine fishing. At that time it was
also in the Boyne, and in Pine Lake and River.
I also took it in Lake Michigan while fishing
for cisco from the pier at Charlevoix. Fish
running from a pound to a pound and a half
were common, and occasionally one of two
pounds was taken.</p>

<p>It is sad to contemplate the gradual disappearance
of this fish from the once densely
populated streams of Michigan. At the present
day the angler is fortunate, indeed, who succeeds
in taking a brace of grayling where a few years
ago his basket was soon filled. This deplorable
state of affairs has been brought about by the
axe of the lumberman, whose logs, descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the small streams on the spring rise, plough
up the spawning beds, smothering the eggs and
killing the helpless fry. As brook-trout spawn
in the fall they escape this calamity, the fry
being old enough in April to take pretty good
care of themselves. The decrease of both trout
and grayling is commonly attributed to overfishing;
but while this may have its influence
to a limited extent in lessening the numbers for
a season, other causes must be looked for to
account for the permanent depletion of certain
waters.</p>

<p>A stream or pond will support but a
limited number of fish, the number depending
on the supply of natural food for both young
and mature. By the supply of food on one
hand, and the natural enemies of the fish on
the other, a certain balance is maintained which
if disturbed by, say, overfishing one season,
will be restored by natural laws the next. And
this state of affairs will continue so long as the
natural conditions of the waters remain undisturbed.</p>

<p>By cutting down the pine trees at the sources
of the streams and along the small tributaries,
which are the spawning grounds of both trout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and grayling, the natural conditions are changed.
The scorching rays of the summer sun are
admitted where once mosses and ferns and the
trailing arbutus luxuriated in the shade of a
dense growth of pines and hemlocks and firs.
The soil becomes dry, the carpet of green
shrivels and dies, and the myriads of insects
that once bred and multiplied in the cool and
grateful shade, and whose larvæ furnish the food
for the baby fish, disappear. The brooks and
rivulets diminish and vanish. A page has been
torn from the book of nature, and the place
that trout and grayling knew so well is known
no more forever.</p>


<h3>THE MONTANA GRAYLING</h3>

<h4>(<i>Thymallus montanus</i>)</h4>

<p>The Montana grayling was collected by Professor
James W. Milner, of the United States Fish
Commission, in 1872, from a tributary of the
Missouri River, at Camp Baker, in Montana. He
named it <i>montanus</i>, from the name of the state.
Lewis and Clark, however, during their wonderful
journey that blazed the western course of empire,
described, but did not name it, seventy years
before, from fish taken near the head waters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the Jefferson River. A few years ago (1898)
it was my good fortune to be the first to call
attention to this prior description. Knowing that
Lewis and Clark ascended the Jefferson nearly
to its source in the Rocky Mountains, in 1805, I
thought it extremely probable that those remarkably
close observers had mentioned the existence
of this beautiful and well-marked species. Upon
investigation I found my surmise to be correct.
On page 545 of Dr. Elliott Coues's edition (1893)
of "The Lewis and Clark Expedition," I found
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Toward evening we formed a drag of bushes,
and in about two hours caught 528 very good
fish, most of them large trout. Among them we
observed for the first time ten or twelve trout of
a white or silvery color, except on the back and
head, where they are of a bluish cast; in appearance
and shape they resemble exactly the
speckled trout, except they are not so large,
though the scales are much larger; the flavor is
equally good." (In a foot-note Dr. Coues stated
that this fish remained unidentified.)</p>

<p>The locality where these fish were taken was
near the head waters of the Jefferson River, where
Lewis and Clark abandoned their canoes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
crossed the Continental Divide on horses purchased
from the Indians. At this point the grayling
is abundant today, as I know from personal
observation, and coexists with the red-throat trout
almost to the exclusion of all other species.</p>

<p>Lewis and Clark were both remarkable for
clear and correct descriptions of the animals and
plants met with during their journey, many of
which were new to science; but as they neglected
to give them scientific names, others have reaped
the honors of many of their discoveries. I published
my identification of the fish in question as
being undoubtedly the grayling, and soon afterward
received a letter from Dr. Coues, congratulating
me and indorsing my opinion, which he said
was certainly correct.</p>

<p>The Montana grayling is found only in the
tributaries of the Missouri River above the Great
Falls. In Sheep and Tenderfoot creeks, tributaries
of Smith River, in the Little Belt Mountains,
it is fairly abundant, as it is likewise in the
three forks of the Missouri,&mdash;the Gallatin, Madison,
and Jefferson rivers. Its ideal home is in
several tributaries at the head of Red Rock Lake,
swift gravelly streams, and especially in the upper
reaches of the Madison above the upper cañon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
where the water is rapid, though unbroken, the
bottom being dark obsidian sand, with a succession
of pools and shallows. I have taken fish weighing
two pounds in Beaver Creek, in the upper
cañon, which is also an ideal stream. Such situations
are peculiarly adapted to the grayling,
being preferred to the broken water of rocky
streams so much favored by trout.</p>

<p>The Montana grayling is a trimmer-built fish
than its Michigan cousin, being not quite so
deep, proportionally, and with larger scales. Its
dorsal fin is about the same height, but with one
or two less rays.</p>

<p>Its back is gray, with purplish reflections; sides
lighter, with lilac, pink, and silvery reflections;
belly pearly white. It has a few irregularly-shaped
black spots on the anterior part of the
body, but none posteriorly as sometimes on the
Michigan grayling. It has two oblong dark
blotches in the cleft of the lower jaw, and a heavy
dark line running from the ventrals to the pectoral
fin; these markings are more pronounced in the
male, being quite faint or wanting in the female.
The dorsal fin has a rosy-red border, six or seven
rows of roseate, roundish spots, ocellated with
white, and gray blotches form lines between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
rows of red spots; in the upper, posterior angle
of the dorsal fin are several larger oblong rosy
spots; the ventral fins have three rose-colored
stripes along the rays; the pectoral and anal fins
are plain; the caudal fin is forked.</p>

<p>As a game-fish the grayling is fully the equal
of the trout, though its way of taking the artificial
fly is quite different, and the old hand at trout
fishing must pay court to "the lady of the
streams" with the greatest assiduity before he is
successful in winning her attention to his lures.
And even then he must become fully conversant
with her coy and coquettish way of accepting his
offer, though it be cast never so deftly. There
is a rush and snap and vim in the rise of a trout
to the fly that is lacking with the grayling. The
trout often leaps above the water to seize the fly,
while it is taken more quietly and deliberately,
though just as eagerly, by the grayling from
below. In other words, it is "sucked in," as
English anglers term it, though that hardly expresses
it, as the act is not so tame as might be
inferred. On the contrary, the grayling rises
from the bottom of a pool and darts upward like
an arrow to seize the fly, though as a rule it does
not break water, and is not so demonstrative as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the trout; but it seldom misses the mark, if
the fly is small enough, which the trout often
does.</p>

<p>Sometimes the grayling will rise a dozen times
to a fly, and for some reason refuse it, but will
take it at the very next cast. Just why this is so
is one of the unanswerable problems that often
vexes or confounds the angler. Presumably the
fly is too large, or is not presented in just the
right way to please her ladyship. But the angler
should not despair under such circumstances, but
remember the old couplet, "If at first you don't
succeed, try, try again." Moreover, he must remember
that he is fishing for grayling, not for
trout. He must not cast on a riffle, or at its
head, but below, in the eddy or still water, where
it is deepest. There lie the large fish, though
small ones may be in the shallower water, and
it is the latter that perplex one by their antics,
oftentimes leaping over one's flies in play.</p>

<p>Trout generally lie in ambush beneath the
bank, shelving rocks, or roots, usually in shallow
water, from whence they rush with tigerlike ferocity
upon the fly, often leaping over it in their
eagerness for the fancied prey. On the contrary,
grayling lie on the bottom of pools, in swift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
water, entirely in the open. They are also gregarious,
assembling in schools, while the trout is
a lone watcher from his hidden lair.</p>

<p>Some dry fly-fishers of England, echoing the
opinion of Charles Cotton, term the grayling a
"dead-hearted fish" that must be taken with a
wet or sunken fly. This idea of its lack of gameness
is implied in Tennyson's lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i-4">"Here and there a lusty trout.<br /><br /></span>
<span>And here and there a grayling."<br /><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the English grayling grows only to half of
the weight of the trout, it suffers by comparison
when killed on the heavy rods of our English
brothers. Their assertion, also, that the grayling
has a tender mouth, and must be handled gingerly,
is another fallacy, inasmuch as it has as
tough lips as the trout, but the smaller hooks of
grayling flies do not hold so firmly as the larger
and stronger hooks of trout flies.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the grayling is
not a leaping fish because it takes the fly from
beneath the surface of the water. On the contrary,
in its playful moods it may be seen leaping
above the surface the same as a trout, and moreover
it breaks water repeatedly after being hooked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
which the trout seldom does. It puts up a stiff
fight also beneath the surface, being much aided
in its resistance by its tall dorsal fin. It is no
disparagement, then, to the gamesome trout, to
declare the grayling its equal when of similar
size and weight.</p>

<p>Grayling fishing has been practised in England
for centuries. In addition to fly-fishing, swimming
the maggot, where a tiny float is used, is
a common method. An artificial bait, called the
grasshopper, is likewise employed. While grayling
are taken during the trout season, in spring
and summer, the most successful season seems to
be from September to December, when they are
at their best, both as to gameness and condition.</p>

<p>With English anglers the universal practice is
to fish up-stream, as the fish are not so apt to see
the angler, and that plan undoubtedly has its
advantages in the clear and shallow streams of
England. In fishing for grayling, however, it is
advised by some of their best anglers to cast
across the stream, instead of above, and allow the
flies to float down. No reason is given for this
deviation from the generally accepted method
with trout; but I imagine that as grayling lie on
the bottom of deep pools, it has been found by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
experience that they are not so apt to see the
angler as other species in mid-water or near the
surface, especially in the clear chalk streams.</p>

<p>In America, the streams being deeper, the necessity
for fishing up-stream is not so apparent.
Fishing down-stream is by far the best plan, for
obvious reasons, if the angler wades slowly and
cautiously, so as not to roil the water. The principal
reason is that one's line is always straight
and taut in swift water, and the flies can be more
easily controlled and floated down over the fish,
which always heads up-stream. Upon hooking
the fish it can be drawn to one side, whereby the
other fish in the pool are not much more alarmed
than in the case of casting up or across. Casting
across seems to be really a concession to the
advantage of fishing down-stream.</p>

<p>The fly-rod, reel, line, and leader ordinarily
employed for trout-fishing may be used also for
grayling, though I would advise some modifications.
While a first-class split-bamboo rod of
three and a half or four ounces may be advantageously
used by an angler who knows how to handle
a very light rod, I prefer one of five or six ounces.
Such a rod is certainly light enough to be used
all day without fatigue, and it is well to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
resourceful reserve of an ounce or two for emergencies.
In any case it should not exceed ten
and one-half feet in length, if built on the modern
plan, where most of the pliancy is in its upper
two-thirds, the lower third being stiffish and
springy, constituting its backbone. A very good
rod can be constructed with ash butt, and lancewood,
greenheart, or bethabara upper pieces, and
one that will be almost as light as split-bamboo,
and certainly more serviceable in the long run.
I would also advise flush, non-dowelled joints,
and reel-bands instead of a solid reel-seat, the latter
being of no advantage and only adding to the
weight of the rod; moreover, it is now put on
the cheapest rods to make them sell. A plain
groove for the reel, with bands, is very much better.</p>

<p>As a matter of course the line should be of
braided silk, enamelled, and suited to the weight
of the rod, as small as size G, but not larger than
size E. It may be level, but a tapered line is
better for casting, and is also better adapted for
the delicate leader that must be employed.</p>

<p>A tapered leader six feet long is best, but
should not be shorter than four feet. It must be
made of the very best silkworm gut fibre, round,
clear, and unstained. The distal end should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
made of the finest drawn gut, known as gossamer,
and taper to the larger or proximal end, which
should be the smallest undrawn gut.</p>

<p>In England the most delicate leaders and extremely
small flies are employed for grayling.
The flies are usually tied on Pennell hooks, turndown
eye, sizes 0, 00, 000, Kendal scale, which
are smaller than No. 12, Redditch scale, the latter
being the smallest size commonly used in America.
The favorite flies in England have yellowish&mdash;lemon
to orange&mdash;bodies, and bodies of peacock
harl, either green or bronze. Flies with
purplish, black, or slate-colored bodies are more
sparingly employed. They are either hackles or
split-winged flies. The formulas for some of the
favorites are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Red Tag.</i> Body bright green harl from the "moon" of a peacock's
feather; hackle, bright red cock's hackle; tag, bright red wool;
hook, No. 0, Kendal scale.</p>

<p><i>Orange Bumble.</i> Body, orange floss silk, ribbed with a strand of
peacock's sword feather and fine flat gold tinsel; hackle, honey
dun cock, wrapped all down the body; hook No. 0, Kendal
scale.</p>

<p><i>Green Insect.</i> Body, bright green peacock's harl; hackled with a
soft silver-gray hen's feather; hook No. 0, Kendal scale.</p>

<p><i>Bradshaw's Fancy.</i> Body, copper-colored peacock's harl; hackled
with a feather from the neck of a Norwegian crow; tag, bright
crimson wool or silk, with a couple of turns of the same at the
head; tying silk, dark purple; hook No. 0, Kendal scale.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Claret Bumble.</i> Body, claret floss silk, ribbed with a strand of peacock's
sword feather; medium blue dun cock's hackle; hook.
No. 0, Kendal scale.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the foregoing are fancy flies, but are
considered the best killers on English waters. In
this country it has been demonstrated, also, that
flies with bodies of peacock harl, or with yellowish
bodies, have been more uniformly successful
than others. From this it would appear that the
predilection of grayling for certain colors in artificial
flies is much the same both in this country
and England. From my own experience I can
recommend the following well-known flies, adding,
however, that their construction should be a little
different from the conventional trout flies of these
names in having a red tag or tail of scarlet
wool, instead of the usual tail, and in having narrow
split wings instead of the regular style of
full wings:&mdash;</p>

<p>Yellowish-bodied flies: professor, queen of the
water, Oconomowoc, Lord Baltimore. Green-bodied
flies: coachman, Henshall, and grizzly king.
Other useful flies are black gnat, cinnamon, iron-blue
dun, oriole, red ant, gray hackle, and black
hackle. They should all be tied on Sproat or
O'Shaughnessy hooks, No. 12, Redditch or com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>mon
scale. Two flies only should be used in a
cast, and of different colors.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that the portions of a stream
mostly used by grayling are the sandy and gravelly
pools in swift, smooth water, they are fished
for in much the same way as trout, except that
the flies are allowed to sink below the surface,
very much as in black-bass fishing. It is very
important that the line and leader are always taut,
inasmuch as the rise of the fish is not always seen,
except as a quick flash or shadow beneath the
surface. With a tight line the fish will be more
apt to hook itself. With the small hooks of grayling
flies, it is not wise for the angler to attempt
to "strike," as in trout or black-bass fishing.</p>

<p>Upon hooking the fish it should be led sidewise
from the pool, if possible, so as not to disturb or
frighten the others of the school; and for the
same reason it should be kept near the surface
until taken into the landing-net.</p>

<p>Either a light trout bait-rod or the fly-rod may
be employed for bait-fishing for grayling, with
fine silk line, leader, and hooks Nos. 6 to 8 with
a split-shot sinker a foot above the hook. English
anglers use a small float, but in fishing <ins class="correction" title="text was 'downstream'">down-stream</ins>
it is not advisable, as the current prevents <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the bait from touching the bottom, and renders
the use of a float for this purpose unnecessary.
The bait should be kept from six inches to a foot
above the bottom. The best bait is the larva of
the caddis-fly, a small worm or caterpillar encased
in a bag or covering composed of bits of bark,
sticks, etc.; it is known in the Rocky Mountain
region as the "rockworm." Earthworms, small
grasshoppers, crickets, and grubs of various kinds
are also useful.</p>

<p>When it became known to fishculturists, about
1874, that the grayling existed in Michigan,
attempts were made to propagate it artificially,
but without success, as the same lines were
pursued as with the brook-trout. It remained for
the United States Fish Commission to successfully
cope with the problem in Montana, under
my supervision. Beginning with 1898, we have
hatched millions at Bozeman Station and the
auxiliary station near Red Rock Lake, at the
head of the Jefferson River. We have also
shipped millions of eggs to different parts of the
Union, as far east as Maine, New Hampshire, and
Vermont, mostly to United States Fish Commission
stations, where they were hatched and planted
in suitable streams. It is to be hoped that some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of these plants will result in the permanent
establishment of this beautiful and desirable fish
in eastern waters.</p>

<p>The eggs of the grayling are smaller than those
of the trout, being but one-seventh of an inch in
diameter. When first extruded they are amber-colored,
owing to a large oil-drop, which renders
them lighter than trout eggs, almost semi-buoyant,
and for this reason are best hatched, or at least
"eyed," in hatching jars. My plan is to keep
them in the hatching jars until the eye-spots show,
when they are removed to hatching-trays until
incubation is complete.</p>

<p>In a few days after extrusion the eggs become
crystal-like or hyaline in color, when the embryo
can be seen in motion. The period of incubation
is from ten days to two weeks. The fry when
hatched are very small, about the size of mosquito
"wigglers" (larvæ). Their umbilical yolk-sac is
absorbed in a few days, when it becomes imperative
to supply them with stream water, which
contains the small organisms (<i>Entomostraca</i>) on
which they feed at first. Afterward they can be
fed artificially the same as trout fry, which they
soon outgrow.</p>

<p>There is an erroneous opinion that has gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
considerable currency among anglers to the
effect that grayling and trout are antagonistic,
and that to this cause is to be attributed the
decrease of grayling in the waters of Michigan.
My observations have led me to the conclusion
that this opinion is not supported by any evidence
whatever. When I fished the streams of that
state, years ago, both trout and grayling were
plentiful in the same waters, and were living in
harmony as they had done from time immemorial.
Their habits and choice of locality being different,
the trout hiding under cover and the grayling
lying in exposed pools, their struggle for existence
or supremacy does not bring them much in
opposition, or cause them to prey on each other
or on their eggs or fry in an unusual degree, or
to such an extent as to effect the marked decrease
of either species. Honors are even. It is the
same in Montana. In that state the red-throat
trout and grayling seek out such portions of the
streams as are best suited to them; but very often
they are found together on neutral ground, where
they live peaceably and not at variance with each
other. As no disturbing element has yet been introduced,
their numbers still bear the same relative
proportion that has existed since the days of yore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>


<p>Likewise in England, in such historic waters
as the Wye, the Derwent, the Wharfe, or the
Dove, hallowed by "meek Walton's heavenly
memory," the grayling and trout still coexist in
about the same relative proportion that has been
maintained since and before the days of Dame
Juliana Berners, Izaak Walton, and Charles
Cotton in the fifteenth century. On those
quiet streams no cause has ever been allowed
to militate against the well-being of either
species, or to disturb the natural conditions to
any considerable extent.</p>

<p>In a recent number of the <i>London Fishing
Gazette</i> is one of the best articles on the English
grayling that I have ever seen. It is written by
Mr. E. F. Goodwin, who is undoubtedly fully
conversant with his theme and well acquainted
with the habits of that fish. Among other things
he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When in season I maintain that the grayling
will give excellent sport on suitable tackle, is
splendid eating, and is as handsome a fish as
any angler need wish to gaze upon. What more
can one want? How Charles Cotton could have
written in such terms of condemnation of the
sporting qualities of this fish as to call him 'one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of the deadest-hearted fishes in the world, and
the bigger he is the more easily taken,' passes
my understanding, although we must remember
that this remark was passed to 'Viator' on his
catching a grayling in the early part of March,
when the fish would be out of condition in all
probability. I confess to a feeling of disappointment
at the summary way in which Walton dismisses
the grayling, showing that he did not
think very highly of him either from an edible
or sporting point of view.</p>

<p>"Grayling will rise readily to the artificial fly,
and although they will come again time after
time if missed (or perhaps I should say if they
miss the fly, which is more usual), they require
the neatest and finest tackle and the most delicate
handling to secure them; and as Francis
Francis truly says, 'when you have hooked a
grayling, your next job is to land him.' ...
There is a lot of difference between the way a
well-conditioned trout and grayling fight after
being hooked, and this may account for some
of the condemnation heaped upon the latter as
to its non-sportive character; for although not so
lively as the trout with its mad rushes for liberty,
yet the kind of resistance is more dangerous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the hold you have on him, for the grayling tries
the hold of the hook in every possible way, and
from every possible point of that hold. To my
mind a grayling is much more difficult to
land than a trout, and the more I fish for
grayling the more convinced I am of his gameness
and sporting qualities. Certainly there are
a great many more grayling lost after being
hooked than trout, and this is accounted for principally
not so much from the reputed tenderness
of the mouth as from the fact of the fish not
being so firmly hooked as the trout usually is.</p>

<p>"The ideas of grayling not heading up-stream
and of being deleterious to the trout have been
perpetuated by author after author, just copying
one another without really ascertaining the facts....
As regards the advisability of introducing
grayling into a trout stream, that depends entirely
upon the nature of the river. As far as
my experience and observation go, grayling only
become detrimental to the trout in that, being
active and voracious feeders, they consume the
food that otherwise would have belonged to and
been partaken of by the trout. It is certain that
these fish live together in general amity. The
grayling is but seldom a fish eater, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
any accusation as to its being destructive to the
fry of trout is untenable. That it, in the trout-spawning
season, may help itself to what it can
find of the superfluous ova which float down the
stream no one can object to, but as to its burrowing
in the redds and disturbing the hatching ova.
I very much doubt it. Both the late Dr. Brunton
and Dr. Hamilton were very strong in their
assertion that this was a matter of impossibility
with the grayling, and yet we are assured by
Dr. James A. Henshall that the fry of grayling
are as much addicted to cannibalism as the pike-perch
fry."</p>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_242.jpg">THE MORE SPORTSMANLY WAY OF CATCHING</a></p>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_242.jpg">MASCALONGE</a></p>
</div>

<p>After giving a brief space to natural bait-fishing,
he goes on to say: "But after all there
is only one way in which this fish should be
caught, and that is with the fly. This ground
has been gone over so many times that it only
remains for me to say that, the grayling being
a bold and daring riser, never be discouraged
if you fail to hook him, even if he rise at your
fly time after time. He lies very low in the river
when watching for his prey, and therefore is not
so easily disturbed; and if you remain quite still
when he has risen and missed the fly and gone
down to his lair, he will surely rise again. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
rise, too, is different to a trout. A trout, from
lying close to the surface when feeding, takes
without effort the flies floating over him, and also
is easily scared. A grayling, from lying deep
in the water, quite close to the bottom, comes up
with great rapidity, and seldom takes the fly
until it has passed him; and should he miss it,
which often happens, disappears so quickly that
he may well be compared to a shadow&mdash;hence
the name of 'umber,' from <i>umbra</i>, a shadow.
Should you hook him, up goes his great dorsal
fin and down goes his head in his determination
to get to his hiding-place, and it depends on
his size and gameness, as well as the skill of
the angler, whether he succeeds or not. I have
often heard anglers complain that grayling are
more difficult to hook than trout. Experienced
anglers are all aware that grayling are not so
easily hooked on the rise as trout, but he offers
the best compensation in his power by consenting
to rise over and over again until if you do not
hook him the fault is yours, not his. When he
rises at a passing fly he must ascend at lightning
speed in order to cover the distance in time to
catch it; having done so, he turns instantly head
down and descends at the same speed. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
really the 'somersault' so well known to grayling
fishers. With a long line it is next to impossible
to strike a grayling on the instant, and a taut
line in this fishing is of even greater importance
than in trout-fishing."</p>

<p>I have given the above liberal quotations because
the article agrees so well with my own
practice in grayling fishing, and accords with the
habits of the American graylings as I have observed
them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SALMON FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Salmonidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>This is quite an extensive family, embracing
the salmons, trouts, and whitefishes, and is characterized
principally by an adipose fin and small,
smooth scales. It is my province to consider
only the Rocky Mountain whitefish and the cisco,
as the salmons and trouts are described in another
volume of this series. There are a number
of whitefishes, but none of them can be considered
game-fishes except the one about to be
described, as they rarely or never take the fly or
bait.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Coregonus williamsoni.</i> Rocky Mountain Whitefish. Head 4-1/2 to
5; depth 4 to 5; eye 4-2/3; D. 11 to 14; A. 11 to 13; scales 8 to
10-83 to 87-7 to 10; body oblong, little compressed; head
short, conic, the profile rather abruptly decurved; snout compressed
and somewhat pointed at tip, which is below the level
of the eye; preorbital broad, 2/3 the width of the eye; maxillary
short and very broad, reaching to the anterior margin of eye,
and is contained 4 times in length of head; mandible 3 times;
gill-rakers short and thick, 9 + 15; pectoral fin 1-1/5 in head;
ventral 1-2/5; adipose fin large, extending behind the anal fin.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>


<blockquote><p><i>Coregonus williamsoni cis-montanus.</i> Montana Whitefish. Head 5;
depth 5 to 5^1; pectoral fin 1^1 in head; ventral 1-4/5; scales 90.
Otherwise like the typical form.</p>

<p><i>Argyrosomus artedi sisco.</i> Cisco. Head 4 to 5; depth 4 to 4-1/2;
eye 4 to 5; D. 10; A. 12; scales 8-65 to 80-8; body long,
slender and somewhat compressed; head long, pointed and compressed;
mouth large, lower jaw somewhat projecting, maxillary
reaching to pupil; mandible 2-1/3 in head; dorsal fin high, its
rays rapidly shortened; caudal fin forked.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN WHITEFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Coregonus williamsoni</i>)</h4>

<p>This fine fish was first described from the Des
Chutes River in Oregon by Dr. Charles Girard
in 1856, who described most of the fishes collected
during the Pacific Railroad Survey, and
named the one under consideration in honor of
Lieutenant R. S. Williamson, who had charge of
one of the divisions of the Survey.</p>

<p>Its general form is not unlike that of the grayling,
which has led to the absurd opinion, held by
some, that the grayling is a hybrid, or cross, between
this whitefish and the red-throat trout, its
body being rather long, nearly elliptical in outline,
and somewhat compressed. It is found in the
clear streams on both slopes of the Rocky Mountains,
and on both sides of the Cascade Range. In
the tributaries of the Missouri River in Montana
it differs slightly from the typical form, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
known as the variety <i>cis-montanus</i>. It is bluish
or greenish on the back, sides silvery, belly white.
All of the fins are tipped with black; caudal and
adipose fins are steel-blue.</p>

<p>I know this fish only from the streams of Montana,
where it coexists with the red-throat trout and
grayling. It spawns in the fall. It feeds on insects
and their larvæ, small crustaceans, and the
eggs of other fishes. It grows to about a foot in
length, usually, and to a pound in weight, though
I have taken much larger specimens. It is a
very fair food-fish,&mdash;as good, I think, as the
red-throat trout, as its flesh is firmer and flaky,
and devoid of any muddy or musky flavor.</p>

<p>It rises to the artificial fly as readily as the
trout or grayling, and to the same flies, though a
little more partial to small, dark, or grayish ones,
as black, brown, and gray hackles, black gnat,
oriole, gray drake, etc. When the streams are
higher and not so clear, lighter-colored flies are
useful, as professor, coachman, Henshall, miller,
etc. Light trout fly-rods and tackle are used
both for fly and bait-fishing by Rocky Mountain
anglers,&mdash;the bait, when used, being the larva of
the caddis-fly, and known as "rockworm." Grasshoppers
are employed in the late summer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
fall. Fly-fishing, however, is the most successful
method.</p>

<p>Large baskets of whitefish are made in the
three forks of the Missouri River, especially in
the lower Gallatin River, where it is taken with
the grayling, the red-throat trout not being so
plentiful in that part of the stream. The tributaries
of this river are also well supplied with
whitefish. Bridger Creek, one of the tributaries
of East Gallatin River, has some large whitefish.
I have taken them in that stream up to two
pounds; for gameness they were equal to trout of
the same weight, and just as good for the table.
They are at their best in the early fall months,
before spawning, when they are fat and in fine
fettle. At this season they must be looked for in
deep holes, especially in August and September,
when they are gregarious, and one's basket may
be filled from a single hole when of considerable
extent. Later they depart for the shallows and
pair off for spawning, when they seldom rise to
the fly.</p>

<p>There is a sentiment among trout fishers,
and among people generally in a trout region,
that no other fish is quite so good to eat, or possessed
of as much gameness, as the trout. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
I concede beauty of form and coloration to the
trout, far excelling all other fresh-water fishes,
there are others equally as good for the table,
or even better. When camping by mountain
streams, freshly-caught trout, fried to crispness
in bacon fat, has a happy combined trout-bacon
flavor that is certainly delicious, especially when
one has the sauce of a camping appetite to favor
it; but under similar conditions the mountain
whitefish, in my opinion, is fully as good. Nine
out of ten persons who are prejudiced in favor of
the trout will declare that it has no scales, thus
showing a lack of comparison and observation.
In the Rocky Mountain region, where there are
so few species of fish for the angler, usually
only trout, grayling, and whitefish, the latter
should be better appreciated.</p>


<h3>THE CISCO</h3>

<h4>(<i>Argyrosomus artedi sisco</i>)</h4>

<p>The cisco, or so-called "lake-herring," was first
described by the French ichthyologist, Le Sueur,
in 1818, from Lake Erie and the Niagara River.
He named it in honor of Petrus Artedi, the associate
of Linnæus, and the "Father of Ichthyology."
The variety <i>sisco</i> was described and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
named by Dr. David Starr Jordan, in 1875, from
Lake Tippecanoe, Indiana. It was for a long
time supposed to exist only in Lake Geneva.
Wisconsin, except in the Great Lakes, and an
absurd opinion was prevalent that there was an
underground communication between that lake and
Lake Superior by which the cisco entered it.
Soon after Dr. Jordan had discovered it in Tippecanoe
Lake I found it in several lakes in Wisconsin,
as La Belle, Oconomowoc, and Okauchee.
The cisco is somewhat smaller than the lake-herring,
but otherwise it is about the same. It is
almost elliptical in outline, the body being compressed.
The mouth is rather large, with the
jaws more projecting than in the lake whitefishes.
The coloration is bluish or greenish on
the back, with silvery sides and white belly. The
scales are sprinkled with black specks. It is a
very pretty fish, is gregarious, swimming in large
schools, and feeds on the minute organisms found
in lakes of good depth. It remains in deep water
most of the year, but resorts to shallower water
in the summer, preparatory to spawning. From
the last of May to June, when the May-fly
appears in vast swarms on the western lakes, the
cisco approaches the surface to feed on them. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
is at this time that they take an artificial fly of
a grayish hue. It grows to a length of ten or
twelve inches, and is highly esteemed as a food-fish.</p>

<p>At Lake Geneva, when the May-fly appears,
crowds of anglers assemble to cast the artificial
fly and the natural "cisco-fly," as the May-fly is
called. A very light trout fly-rod with corresponding
tackle can be utilized for cisco, with
gray hackle, gray drake, or green drake, on hooks
Nos. 8 to 10. The fishing is done from boats
or the shore. In using the natural fly the same
sized hooks mentioned will answer. As the May-fly
alights on every object, the boat and clothing
of the angler as well, the supply of bait is constant
and convenient.</p>

<p>The cisco can be caught in winter, through
the ice, in water from fifty to seventy-five feet
deep, and many are taken in this way from the
lakes near Oconomowoc, Wisconsin. A small
white or bright object is used as a decoy to
attract the fish, which is kept in motion near the
baited hook, and on a separate line. The bait
may be a very small bit of white bacon or ham
fat, or fish flesh, though insect larva is better.</p>

<p>When the talismanic words, "The cisco is run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>ning,"
are pronounced, crowds of anglers from
Chicago, Milwaukee, and all intermediate points,
with a unanimity of purpose, rush as one man
to the common centre of Lake Geneva, in eager
anticipation of the brief but happy season of "ciscoing."
Anglers of every degree&mdash;armed with
implements of every description, from the artistic
split-bamboo rod of four ounces to the plebeian
cane pole or bucolic sapling of slender proportions,
and with lines of enamelled silk, linen, or
wrapping cord&mdash;vie with one another in good-natured
rivalry in the capture of the silvery cisco.
Very little skill is required to fill the creel, as the
schools are on the surface of the water in myriads,
and the most bungling cast may hook a fish.
Though the etymology of the cisco is unknown,
it is a veritable entity, whose name is legion during
the month of June at Lake Geneva.</p>

<p>The cisco is a localized variety of the so-called
lake-herring of the Great Lakes, and holds the
same relation to it that the landlocked salmon
does to the Atlantic salmon. Being confined to
small lakes, the cisco does not grow so large as
the lake herring. Before the Chicago and Milwaukee
railway was built, in Wisconsin, there
was a plank road extending from Milwaukee to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Watertown, and thirty miles west of Milwaukee
this road crossed the outlet of Oconomowoc Lake.
Within fifty yards or so of the bridge there stood
a roadside tavern where the freight wagons
stopped at noon on their way from Lake Michigan
to Watertown. I have been informed by old
residents of that section that in the fall of the
year, about the spawning period of the cisco,
boxes of fresh fish were frequently carried by
these wagons, some of which were cleaned and
dressed for dinner on the bank of the outlet of
the lake, and the offal thrown into the stream.
It is not unlikely, inasmuch as the fish were so
recently caught, that the eggs and milt of the
cisco thus became commingled, fertilizing the eggs,
which were subsequently hatched. This opinion
is supported by the fact that the cisco is found
in that locality only in the chain of lakes composed
of Oconomowoc, Okauchee, and La Belle
lakes, all of which are connected by Oconomowoc
River. It is possible that Lake Geneva was
stocked in a similar manner from Racine or
Kenosha. If it is objected that eggs from dead
fish would not be fertilized, there is still a tenable
theory: When the fish are taken from the
nets alive, many of them are so ripe that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
eggs and milt ooze from them. Under these
circumstances some of the eggs would become
fertilized without a doubt, and by adhering to the
fish when placed in the boxes for transportation,
they might be carried to the place mentioned,
and there deposited in the stream in the manner
related.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE DRUM FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Sciænidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>The drumfish or croaker family is quite a large
one, comprising nearly one hundred and fifty
species, inhabiting the sandy shores of the seas or
the brackish water of the bays and estuaries, sometimes
ascending tributary rivers to fresh water;
the fresh-water drum, hereafter to be described,
however, is the only species permanently residing
in fresh water. The members of this family have
usually an elongate body, with rough-edged
(ctenoid) scales; the dorsal fin is deeply notched,
or in some species separated into two fins, with
the soft-rayed portion, or the second dorsal, composed
of many rays, while the spiny-rayed portion
has but few; some have barbels, but all have large
ear-bones; the air-bladder is usually large and
complicated, and is supposed to be the source of
the drumming, croaking, or grunting sounds common
to most of the species.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE WEAKFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Cynoscion regalis</i>)</h4>

<p>The weakfish, or squeteague, was first described
by Bloch and Schneider, in 1801, from the vicinity
of New York. They named it <i>regalis</i>, or "royal."
In the Southern states it is called gray-trout and
sea-trout. The name weakfish is doubtless derived
from the Dutch, and is said to have originally
meant a soft fish. Jacob Steendam, in a poem
in "Praise of New Netherland," in 1661, has</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"Weekvis, en Schol, en Carper, Bot, en Snoek,"</span>
</div></div>

<p>meaning weakfish, plaice, carp, turbot, and pike.
The name squeteague is of Indian origin.</p>

<p>The natural habitat of the weakfish is along
the Atlantic coast south of Cape Cod, occasionally
straying to the Gulf of Mexico. It is most
abundant between Buzzards Bay and Chesapeake
Bay. It is a handsome, shapely fish, resembling
somewhat the salmon in outline. It has a robust
body, with a depth of about one-fourth of its
length. It has a long, pointed head, nearly as
long as the depth of the body. The mouth is
large, with projecting lower jaw. The teeth are
sharp, in narrow bands, with several fanglike
canines in front of the upper jaw. The dorsal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
fins are but slightly separated, and the caudal fin
is almost square.</p>

<p>The color of the back and top of the head is
bluish or bluish gray, with silvery sides and white
belly, and with purple and golden iridescence.
A series of dark, diffused spots or blotches form
transverse or oblique streaks, more pronounced
on the upper part of the body, from whence they
run downward and forward. The cheeks and
gill-covers are silvery and chin yellowish; the
ventral and anal fins are orange; dorsal fin
dusky; pectoral fins yellowish; caudal fin with
upper part dark and lower part yellowish.</p>

<p>The weakfish is a warm-water fish, visiting the
coast and bays during the spring, summer, and
fall, though more abundant in the summer.
They are surface feeders, and swim in large
schools in quest of menhaden, scup, and other
small fishes. They are more numerous some
seasons than others, probably owing to certain
conditions affecting their food, temperature of
water, and the abundance or scarcity of their
enemy, the bluefish. They seldom, if ever,
ascend the streams to fresh water, but remain
about the outer beaches, entering the inlets and
estuaries on the flood tide in pursuit of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
prey, and go out again with the ebb; at least this
is the habit of the largest fish, known as "tide-runners."
Smaller fish probably remain in the
bays and bayous, resorting to deep holes at low
water.</p>

<p>Its breeding habits are not well understood,
though it spawns in the bays in early summer,
about May or June. The eggs are quite small,
about thirty to the inch, are buoyant or floating,
and hatch in a few days, usually in two. I have
taken many hundreds in Chesapeake Bay in
August, but do not remember ever catching
one containing roe during that month. It is an
excellent food-fish if perfectly fresh, but soon
deteriorates, becoming quite soft and losing its
characteristic flavor when out of the water a few
hours. It is quite an important commercial fish
during summer in the eastern markets. Small
ones, below a pound in weight, are delicious pan-fish;
larger ones should be baked. Its usual
weight is two or three pounds, and its maximum
ten or twelve; occasionally they are taken still
heavier&mdash;twenty or twenty-five pounds.</p>

<p>Being a surface feeder it is a good game-fish
on light tackle, taking bait or an artificial fly with
a rush and snap that reminds one of a trout,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and for a short time it resists capture bravely.
Its first spurt, when hooked, is a grand one, and
when checked darts in various directions, making
for the weeds if any are near, or toward the bottom,
or rushing to the surface leaps out, shaking
itself madly to dislodge the hook. It must be
handled carefully and gingerly, for it has a tender
mouth from which the hook is apt to be torn if
too much strain is exerted at first.</p>

<p>A very light striped-bass rod may be utilized,
but the most suitable is the "Little Giant" rod of
seven and one-half feet and eight ounces in ash
and lancewood. A good multiplying reel with
fifty yards of braided linen line, size G, a three-foot
leader, and snelled hooks, Sproat the best.
Nos. 1-0 to 3-0 for the tide-runners, and Nos. 1
or 2 for school fish, together with a landing-net,
constitute the rest of the tackle.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory mode of fishing for weakfish
is from a boat anchored near the channel, or
tied to a pier or wharf in a tideway. The time
for fishing is on the flood tide, from half flood
to half ebb, as the tide-runners are going in or
out in large schools. As little noise as possible
should be made by any necessary movements in
the boat, as the fish are easily frightened. Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
casts should be made toward the advancing or
retreating fish, and the bait kept in motion by
being reeled in. No sinker or float is required,
as the bait must be kept near the surface. Menhaden
or minnows, shedder-crab, lobster, bloodworms,
clam, and shrimp are all good natural baits.
A small spinner, or a small mother-of-pearl squid,
if reeled in rapidly, often proves very taking; also
a large, gaudy fly, as the red ibis, soldier, silver
doctor, Jock Scott, royal coachman, etc., can be
used with good effect when the fish are running
strongly and in goodly numbers.</p>

<p>Still-fishing, with a float, and a sinker adapted
to the strength of the tidal current, can be practised
in the eddies of the tide, or at slack water
near deep holes, using the natural baits mentioned.
Another method is casting with heavy
hand-line in the surf from the outside beaches,
using block tin or bone squids, and hauling the
fish in, when hooked, by main strength. The
largest fish are taken in this way; but while it is
in a degree exciting, it can only be said to be
fishing, not angling. Many anglers, however,
prefer it to any other mode of fishing. Another
favorite method, but a tame one, is drifting with
the wind and tide, following a school of fish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
taking them by trolling with hand-line. If suitable
rods and tackle were used, it would not be
objectionable.</p>

<p>Next to the striped-bass the weakfish is the
most important game-fish of the East Coast, and
to judge from the greater number of anglers who
pursue "weakfishing," it is far and away the
favorite with the majority. The estuaries and
bays of the Jersey coast, Long Island, and Staten
Island, and along the Sound, afford good fishing
in the season and at favorable stages of the tide.
These localities are more frequented by anglers
than any other section of the East Coast. While
ideal angling can only be found on inland waters
in casting the fly for salmon, black-bass, or trout,
amidst the rural and pastoral scenes of hill and
hollow, with the birds and sweet-scented blossoms
ever near the rippling streams&mdash;a full measure
of enjoyment is vouchsafed to the salt-water
angler in the exhilarating sail to the fishing-banks,
the sunlit crests of the incoming tide, and
the health-giving ozone of the chlorinated breeze.
Then follows the ready response of the gamy weakfish
to the angler's lure, the brave fight and happy
landing of the prize. This is surely sport galore,
and not to be gainsaid by the most prejudiced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>



<h3>THE BASTARD WEAKFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Cynoscion nothus</i>)</h4>

<p>The bastard weakfish was first described by
Dr. Holbrook, in 1860, from the coast of South
Carolina. He named it <i>nothus</i>, meaning "bastard,"
in contradistinction to the well-known
weakfish just described. It is a rare fish of the
South Atlantic coast, preferring deep water, but
otherwise of similar habits, and of the same
general form as the weakfish of the northern
waters. It differs from it in coloration, and has
somewhat smaller scales, a smaller mouth, and
more compressed body, which is also a little
deeper and more elevated. Its color is grayish-silvery,
thickly sprinkled with small, dark specks
on the upper half of the body, and silvery below,
a row of dark spots marking the division. There
is another species inhabiting the Gulf coast
which will be noticed later. Whenever met with
they can be taken by the same methods and with
the same tackle as recommended for the northern
weakfish.</p>


<h3>THE KINGFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Menticirrhus saxatilis</i>)</h4>

<p>The kingfish is also known as barb and sea
mink in the North, and in the South as whiting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
It was first described by Bloch and Schneider, in
1801, from the vicinity of New York. They
named it <i>saxatilis</i>, meaning "living among rocks,"
which by the way it does not do, as it prefers
hard, sandy shoals. Its range extends along the
Atlantic coast south of Buzzards Bay, occasionally
straying to the Gulf of Mexico. It is most
abundant, however, between Montauk Point and
Cape Hatteras.</p>

<p>It has a long, rather round body, not much
compressed, its depth being nearly a fourth of its
length. The head is long, with a blunt snout
projecting beyond the mouth, which is small,
with tough, leathery lips, and with a single barbel
on the chin. Both jaws have bands of small,
brushlike teeth, the outer ones in the upper jaw
somewhat longer. The upper angle of the caudal
fin is sharp, the lower angle rounded.</p>

<p>Its color is gray with steely lustre on the back,
fading gradually to the belly, which is bluish
white. There are several dark, oblique bands,
running from the back downward and forward,
and one extending from the nape downward, forming
a broad "V" with the one next to it; along
the border of the belly is a horizontal dark streak
running from the middle of the body to the tail.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>


<p>The kingfish is a bottom feeder, and as might
be inferred from the character of the teeth is
partial to crabs, shrimps, young lobsters, and
mussels, but does not object to the sand-lance
and other small fishes, and sandworms, and is
found on the hard, sandy shoals where such
organisms abound. It visits the shores from
spring until November, but is more abundant in
the summer, when it enters the bays and rivers.
It is usually found in deep water, feeding along
the channels. Although it seems to consort a
good deal with the weakfish, its habits of feeding
are quite different from that fish. It spawns in
the summer, earlier or later, according to the temperature
of the water, though but little is known
of its breeding habits.</p>

<p>Its flesh is flaky, of firm texture, and has a
delicious flavor when perfectly fresh, which, however,
is lost when out of the water a short time.
It is of small size, usually weighing from a half
pound to two pounds, though occasionally reaching
five or six pounds. But although so small
it is justly esteemed and in great demand, the
smaller ones as pan-fishes, for breakfast, and the
larger ones for chowders, for which it is unexcelled
by any other fish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>


<p>For its size, the kingfish is considered the
gamest of all salt-water fishes. It bites savagely,
suddenly, and with a vim and purpose that are
sometimes startling to the unwary angler. And
when he takes the proffered bait he stands not
upon the order of going, but goes at once, and
with a dash that is remarkable for its length in
so small a fish. When checked, he darts from
side to side with amazing quickness, or makes
straight for the surface, when the angler is surprised
to find him of so small a size. He is
<i>multum in parvo</i>,&mdash;a large soul in a small body.</p>

<p>In sheltered estuaries and bays where the tide
does not run strongly or swiftly, or during the
stages of slack water, the most suitable tackle
consists of a black-bass bait-rod and reel, one
hundred yards of fine braided linen line, a three-foot
leader, and Sproat hooks, Nos. 1 or 1-0, on
stout gut snells, the leader being connected with
the line by a brass box-swivel or swivel-sinker of
small size. Where the rush of the tide is greater,
a natural bamboo chum rod or the Little Giant
rod is appropriate, as a heavy sinker must be
used to keep the bait near the bottom. To meet
the varying conditions of the tide, sinkers of
different weights are needed, and a landing-net<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
should not be forgotten when the rod is a light
one.</p>

<p>The fishing is done from a boat anchored near
the edge of the channels or in the vicinity of hard
shoals of sand, ledges of rocks, or near oyster bars,
in water of pretty good depth. The bait may be
shedder-crab, clam, blood-worm, or shrimp. All
are good, but crab is, perhaps, the best, and should
be kept in motion.</p>

<p>The northern kingfish must not be confounded
with the kingfish of the Florida Keys, which is a
fish of the mackerel tribe, akin to the Spanish
mackerel, a game-fish of high order, growing to
a weight of forty pounds. I was amused several
years ago when a correspondent applied to the
angling editor of one of the sportsman's journals
for information concerning the kingfish of
Florida. The editor, not knowing any better,
confounded it with the northern kingfish, and
recommended the usual means of capture for
that fish. I wondered, at the time, how the
inquiring angler succeeded with the nimble acrobat
of the coral reefs, still-fishing, with such tackle.</p>

<p>There are two closely allied species&mdash;the Carolina
whiting (<i>Menticirrhus americanus</i>) and the
surf or silver whiting (<i>Menticirrhus littoralis</i>),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
which differ somewhat in coloration and in some
unimportant structural differences; otherwise they
are very similar to the kingfish. The former inhabits
the deeper water, while the latter frequents
the shallow sandy shores of the southern coast
from Carolina to Texas. Their feeding habits
are similar to those of the kingfish, and in their
season they can be captured in the same way.</p>

<h3>THE CROAKER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Micropogon undulatus</i>)</h4>

<p>The croaker was described by Linnæus, in
1766, from South Carolina. He named it <i>undulatus</i>,
"undulating or wavy," owing to the undulating
character of the markings on the body and
fins. Its range extends along the Atlantic coast
and Gulf of Mexico from the Middle states to
Texas, though it is more abundant from the
Chesapeake Bay to Florida. The outline of the
body is somewhat elliptical and compressed, not
much elevated on the back, but with rather a
regular curve from the snout to the tail; its depth
is less than a third of its length. The head is
about as long as the depth of the body, with a
prominent, somewhat blunt snout, and a rather
large mouth, with small barbels beneath the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
jaw. The border of the cheek-bones is strongly
toothed. The teeth of the jaws are in brushlike
bands, with somewhat longer ones in the upper
jaw. There are two dorsal fins, slightly connected;
the caudal fin is double concave or trifurcate.
The back is dusky gray with silvery lustre,
sides silvery or brassy, belly white and iridescent.
There are a number of dusky or cloudy vertical
or oblique bands, and the upper part of the body
is profusely sprinkled with numerous dark spots,
irregularly placed, in undulating lines. A dusky
spot is at the base of the pectoral fin; the dorsal
fins are marked with dark spots, which form lines
along the soft dorsal fin.</p>

<p>The croaker frequents grassy situations in the
brackish water of bays and bayous, feeding on
crabs, shrimps, and other crustaceans, and small
fishes. It grows to a length of ten or twelve
inches, and is a good pan-fish when perfectly
fresh. It spawns in the autumn.</p>

<p>On the grassy flats of the Patapsco and other
tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay I have caught
countless numbers of the "crocus," as we boys
called it. Just under the gill-cover, nearly always,
we found a parasitic crustacean or sea-louse,
a half inch in length, resembling the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
crustacean known as the wood-louse, or sow-bug,&mdash;probably
an isopod.</p>

<p>A very light rod, a fine linen line, snelled
hooks Nos. 1 to 3, and a small sinker or brass
swivel for connecting line and snell are all that
are needed for the croaker, as a reel is not necessary.
The boat is anchored on grassy flats in
water from six to twelve feet in depth. Shrimp
is the best bait, though cut-bait of clam or fish
is good. A float may be used to keep the bait
from the bottom in still water. While this fish
and the next, the spot or Lafayette, are usually
classed as small fry, and particularly suited to
boy anglers, they are such good pan-fish that
many "grown-ups" are quite enthusiastic in their
capture. They hold about the same relation
to the more important game-fishes of the coast
that the sunfishes do to the black-bass, trout,
pike, etc., of inland waters. When no better fishing
offers they will fill the void very satisfactorily
when light and suitable tackle is employed.</p>


<h3>THE LAFAYETTE</h3>

<h4>(<i>Leiostomus xanthurus</i>)</h4>

<p>The Lafayette, spot, or goody, as it is variously
called, was described by Lacépéde, in 1802, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
South Carolina. He named it <i>xanthurus</i>, meaning
"yellow tail," under the impression that its
caudal fin was yellow,&mdash;which, however, it is not.
Its range extends from Cape Cod to Texas,
though it is most abundant from New Jersey to
Florida. It is found throughout its range in
brackish-water bays and bayous, and is somewhat
similar in appearance to the croaker. It
has a short, deep body; the back in front of
the dorsal fin is compressed to a sharp edge or
"razor-back"; the outline of the back is arched,
highest over the shoulder, with a steep profile
from thence to the snout; the depth of the body
is more than a third of its length. The head is
not so long as the depth of the body; the snout is
blunt and prominent; the mouth is small. There
are few or no teeth in the lower jaw, while those
in the upper jaw are quite small. The throat is
well armed with molars and brushlike teeth.
There are two dorsal fins, slightly connected; the
caudal fin is forked. It is bluish or dusky above,
with silvery sides and white belly; when fresh
from the water it is very iridescent. It has
about fifteen narrow, dark, wavy bands extending
obliquely downward and forward, from the back
to below the lateral line; the fins are olivaceous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and plain; it has a very prominent and distinct
round black spot just above the base of the pectoral
fin, which has given rise to the name spot
in some localities.</p>

<p>Like the croaker, the Lafayette resorts to
grassy and weedy situations in the brackish-water
bays, estuaries, and tributaries. In Florida
it is present all the year, but does not enter
northern waters until summer and autumn, when
it is often found in company with the croaker or
white-perch. It feeds on shrimps and other small
crustaceans and small mollusks. It spawns in
southern waters in the fall. Although but a
small fish, growing to eight or ten inches in
length, and usually to but six inches, it is a great
favorite as a pan-fish, as when perfectly fresh it is
a delicious tidbit or <i>bonne-bouche</i> of most excellent
flavor.</p>

<p>The same tackle recommended for the croaker
is well adapted for the spot, though the hooks
should be smaller, Nos. 4 to 6. It is found in
the same situations as the croaker, and often in
shallow water, or about the piling of bridges and
wharves, wherever shrimps abound. My method,
many years ago, was to use a light cane rod, ten
or twelve feet in length, and a fine line of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the same length, very small hooks, about No. 8,
with bait of shrimp, cut clam, oyster, sandworm,
or earthworm. I used no float, but held the rod
elevated sufficiently to keep the bait from touching
the bottom, thus maintaining a taut line, so
that the slightest nibble of the fish could be felt,
when I would endeavor to hook it at once, for it
is as well versed in bait-stealing as the cunner.</p>

<p>It is only necessary to refer to the many names
by which this little fish is known in various sections
of the country to prove its popularity.
Some of these are the spot, goody, Cape May
goody, and Lafayette of northern waters, the
roach and chub of Carolina, and the chopa blanca
(white bream) and besugo (sea-bream) of the
Portuguese and Spanish fishermen of Florida. It
appeared in unusually large numbers in northern
waters about the time that Lafayette visited this
country in 1834, hence one of its numerous names.</p>

<p>Years ago I have seen crowds of men, women,
and boys occupying front seats on the wood-wharves
of Baltimore harbor engaged in fishing
for spots and croakers, on Saturday afternoons,
and many a boy was tardy at Sunday-school the
next morning through picking out the bones from
his Sunday breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE DRUM FAMILY (<i>CONTINUED</i>)</h3>

<h4>(<i>Sciænidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>The most conspicuous and characteristic features
by which the members of this family may
be known were given in the preceding chapter,
where the brackish-water and salt-water species
were described. There is but one species found
in fresh water, a description of which follows.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Aplodinotus grunniens.</i> The Fresh-water Drum. Body oblong,
much elevated, and compressed; profile long and steep; snout
blunt; head 3-1/3; depth 2-3/4; eye moderate; D. X, 30; A. II, 7;
scales 9-55-13; mouth small, low, and horizontal, lower jaw included;
teeth in villiform bands, pharyngeals with coarse, blunt,
paved teeth; preopercle slightly serrate; the dorsal fins somewhat
connected; scaly sheaths at base of spiny portion of dorsal
and anal fins; second anal spine very large; gill-rakers short,
6 + 14; pyloric c&oelig;ca 7; caudal fin double truncate.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE FRESH-WATER DRUMFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Aplodinotus grunniens</i>)</h4>

<p>This well-known fish of the Middle West is
also known as lake-sheepshead on the Great
Lakes, white-perch on the Ohio River, gaspergou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
in Louisiana, and as bubbler, croaker, thunder-pumper,
and other names in various sections of
the country. It was first described by Rafinesque,
in 1819, from the Ohio River. He
named it <i>grunniens</i>, meaning "grunting," from
the grunting sound it makes, in common with
other members of the drum family, when taken
from the water. It inhabits the Great Lakes
and other smaller lakes in the vicinity, extending
along the Mississippi Valley to Louisiana.
Texas, and Mexico.</p>

<p>The fresh-water drum is somewhat elliptical
in outline, with quite a hump over the shoulders,
with a depth of about one-third of its length,
while its head constitutes more than a fourth
of the length of the body. The single dorsal
fin has the appearance of two. The ear-bones
(otoliths) are quite large and resemble porcelain
in their peculiar whiteness, and have a semblance
of the letter "L" seemingly cut on them.
From this circumstance they are known as
"lucky-stones," and are often carried by boys as
pocket-pieces.</p>

<p>It is of a grayish silvery hue, dark on the
back, fading to white on the belly. In the lakes
of the North it has several oblique dusky streaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
or bands, resembling in a minor degree those of
the sheepshead of the coastwise streams and
bays. In southern waters the streaks are not
so apparent, and it is called white-perch, owing
to its silvery appearance. It is a bottom fish,
feeding mostly on mollusks, which it crushes
with the blunt teeth of the throat. It also feeds
on small fishes, crawfish, and other small organisms.
Its spawning habits are unknown, but it
probably spawns in the spring and summer.</p>

<p>On the Great Lakes it grows to an enormous
size, occasionally reaching fifty or sixty pounds,
though as usually taken by anglers it is from three
to ten pounds in weight. It is of no value as a
food-fish in that region, being seldom eaten and
heartily despised. On the Ohio and lower Mississippi
rivers its weight is much less, from one to six
pounds, and it is there considered a good pan-fish,
selling readily in the markets. There is no doubt
but that it is of better flavor in southern waters
when of small size.</p>

<p>As a commercial fish it is taken in nets in
the North, and in fyke-nets in the southern extent
of its range. On northern lakes it is often taken
by anglers when fishing for black-bass, and being
a strong, vigorous fish with the family habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
boring toward the bottom when hooked, it furnishes
fair sport, and with considerable jeopardy
to light tackle, when of large size. The angler
is at first elated with what he imagines to be
a fine bass until its identity is established, when
his enthusiasm gives place to infinite disgust.
And this is one reason why it is despised in
northern waters, and very unjustly, too, for it is
game enough, so far as resistance is concerned,
and is entitled to that much credit. In southern
waters it bites freely at small minnows, crawfish,
or mussels, and is there better appreciated and
has a fair reputation as a game-fish. I have
enjoyed fishing for it with light tackle on White
and St. Francis rivers in Arkansas, and some
of the streams in Mississippi. Light black-bass
tackle is quite suitable for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE MINNOW FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Cyprinidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>This family of fresh-water fishes numbers
probably a thousand species, mostly of small size
in America and known universally as "minnows."
In the eastern hemisphere the species grow
larger, and of these, two have been introduced into
America,&mdash;the German carp and the goldfish.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Cyprinus carpio.</i> The German Carp. Body robust, compressed,
heavy anteriorly; head 4-1/2; depth 3-1/2; scales (normally) 5-38-5;
mouth moderate, with four long barbels; teeth molar, 1, 1, 3-3,
1, 1; dorsal fin elongate, dorsal and anal fins each preceded by
a serrated spine. D. III, 20; A. III, 5.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE GERMAN CARP</h3>

<h4>(<i>Cyprinus carpio</i>)</h4>

<p>The carp was described and named by Linnæus
in 1758. Its original home was in China,
and from thence it was introduced into Europe,
and from there to America.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the carp into the
United States, some thirty years ago, it may now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
be said to inhabit every state in the Union,
having escaped from the ponds in which it was
placed at first, into almost every stream, especially
in the Mississippi Valley.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin is single, extending from the
middle of the back nearly to the tail, highest in
front. In the typical scale-carp the scales are
large, there being about thirty-eight along the
lateral line, with five rows above it and five rows
below. But domestication has greatly altered the
squamation; thus in the leather-carp the body
is naked, with the exception of a few very large
ones on the back; in the mirror-carp there are a
few rows of very large scales. The coloration is
as variable as its scales. It is usually of some
shade of olive or brown, with golden lustre, darkest
on the back, with the belly whitish or yellowish.</p>

<p>In Europe the carp hibernates, or remains
dormant during the winter, burying itself in the
mud of the bottom with its tail only exposed.
In America it seems to have abandoned this
habit almost entirely, especially in the more
southern waters. It is not strictly, if at all, a
herbivorous fish as has been alleged, but stirs up
the bottom of ponds in search of minute animal
organisms, rendering the water foul and muddy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
It also devours the spawn of other fishes, though
some persons contend that it does not, which
is absurd, when it is considered that almost all
fishes are addicted to this natural vice. I know
from my own observation that the carp is not
exempt from the habit. It grows to a length of
two feet under favorable conditions. One of
twenty-four inches will weigh about ten pounds.
As a food-fish it ranks below the buffalo or
sucker. It sells readily, however, to negroes.
Chinese, and Polish Jews of the cities.</p>

<p>I have no love for the German carp, but as it
is now so plentiful in most waters, especially in
the Mississippi Valley, and is constantly increasing
in numbers, it may be well enough to devote
a small space to it as a game-fish. It is a very
poor fish at best, and as the poor we have always
with us, we will never be rid of it. In England,
where it has existed for centuries, it is considered
a very shy and uncertain fish to catch; and the
larger the fish, the more difficult to circumvent.
The best success, and the best is very poor, is
met with on small, stagnant ponds, with comparatively
small fish. English anglers use a small
quill float and split-shot sinker, allowing the bait
to just touch the bottom. They then stick the butt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
of the rod in the ground and retire out of sight
of the fish, watching the float meanwhile. They
use for bait, worms, maggots, and pastes of various
kinds, and usually ground-bait the "swims"
to be fished, a day in advance.</p>

<p>Where the carp are large, five or six pounds,
the rod, reel, and line recommended for black-bass
fishing will subserve a good purpose. A
leader three feet long, stained mud color, must
be used, with small hooks, Nos. 7 or 8, tied on
gut snells. One of the best baits is a red
earthworm.</p>

<p>I think the hook can hardly be too small; Nos.
10 or 12 would probably be more successful than
larger ones, as the fish is apt to eject the bait at
once upon feeling the hook concealed in it.
And this is especially important if such baits as
bread paste, hard-boiled potato, or boiled grain
are employed.</p>

<p>The carp has a peculiar mouth, and feeds
much like the sucker. It draws in mud and
water and food together, strains the water
through the gills, expelling it by the gill-openings,
and probably macerates the residue by
means of the tongue and the cushiony lining of
the buccal cavity before swallowing it. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
this process of mouthing the bait the fish is very
likely to discover the hook, if large, and eject it.</p>

<p>When once hooked, the fish is not to be
lightly esteemed. The angler will have all he
can attend to with a light rod in a weedy pond,
or even in clear water if the fish is of large size.
As most other game-fishes may in time disappear
before the Asiatic carp, the analogue of the Mongolian
boxer, it may be well and prudent to learn
some of the ways to outwit him. In China and
Japan the carp is considered before any other fish
for food, and is emblematic of strength, vigor,
and other good qualities. It is a custom in
Japanese households, upon the birth of a male
child, to hoist a flag representing a carp, in order
that he may grow in strength and all manly
attributes. In England the carp is not much
liked. On the continent of Europe it is considered
a good food-fish, but it is confined in clear
running water to deprive it of its earthy flavor
before it is marketed or eaten. It is likewise
kept within proper bounds, although it has been
cultivated for centuries. In the United States,
however, it has spread over the Mississippi
Valley and elsewhere from overflowed ponds until
it bids fair to become a nuisance, inasmuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
as our waters seem to be particularly suited to it.
As there are so many better species of food-fishes
in this country, both in fresh and salt water,
there was no excuse or necessity for its introduction,
which I consider as great a calamity as
that of the English sparrow or the Shanghai
chicken, and adding a third foreign evil that we
will never be rid of.</p>

<p>I have experimented with carp fishing, but I
think the results were never twice alike. A
great deal depends on the condition of the water.
In ponds that are kept constantly muddy by the
rooting of the carp, it is difficult for them to see
the bait, and they must then depend on the
olfactory sense to find it. This may take a longer
time than the patience of the angler will admit.
When the water is clear, as on a stream, the carp
is too apt to see the angler, and being naturally a
shy fish will not go near the bait under these
circumstances. There is then nothing to do but
to fix the rod in the bank and lie down beside it,
or behind a bush or screen, until the moving of
the float announces the hooking of the fish. By
using a small float, fine line, and very small hooks,
and a variety of baits, as earthworms, boiled
grain or vegetables, pastes of various kinds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
a good stock of patience, one may eventually succeed
in taking a few fish; but the game is hardly
worth the candle.</p>

<p>As the fish has its advocates, however, I add
the following account of angling for carp in
England, where it has been acclimated for
several centuries. The directions given are
abridged from Cornwall Simeon, a writer on
natural history and angling:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The tackle required will simply be a long rod,
a reel containing not less than fifty yards of
fineish line, a fine but sound casting-line nearly
as long as the rod, hooks of about No. 9 size tied
on gut to match, and a small, unpretending float,
besides a good lump of the crumb of new bread,
and a landing-net. Select a quiet, shallow part
of the pond, especially if the weather be hot, and
near its edge stick a few small bushes as a screen.
Then plumb the depth of the water, and cover
the whole of your hook, leaving not the slightest
part visible, with a piece of bread kneaded into
paste, and setting the float two or three feet
<i>farther from the bait</i> than the depth of the water,
throw it well out, drawing in afterward all the
slack of your line. You may then rest your rod
on a forked stick, and sitting down, smoke your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
pipe if you like, and proceed to ground-bait the
place by filliping in bread pills all round your
bait and pretty wide of it. The two great objects
should be not to alarm the carp and to get them
to feed. They are very timid, and if they once
take fright at anything and leave a place in consequence,
it will generally be a good while before
they will return to it. For this reason I prefer
not to throw in any ground-bait when fishing
for them until all my preparations are made and
the actual bait is in the water. When they
begin to come to the bread, if the bottom is at all
muddy and the water not too deep, you will see
lines of mud stirred up by them as they come on,
nuzzling in it like so many pigs. You have
then only to keep quiet and bide your time.
The float will give you sufficient warning when
to strike, and you should only do so when the
carp is going well and steadily away with it. If
your tackle is sound, and you are not in too
great a hurry, you may make pretty sure of landing
him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CATFISH FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Siluridæ</i>)</h4>


<p>The catfish family is represented by many
species in the United States. They have the
body entirely naked, barbels about the mouth,
and an adipose fin, after the fashion of the fishes
of the salmon family. They vary greatly in size,
from the little stone-cat of three inches to the
immense Mississippi-cat of nearly two hundred
pounds. But one species will be noticed.</p>

<p><i>Ictalurus punctatus.</i> The Channel-catfish. Body elongate, slender,
compressed posteriorly; head 4; depth 5; eye large; D. I, 6;
A. 25 to 30; head slender and conical; mouth small, upper jaw
longest; barbels long, the longest reaching considerably beyond
the gill opening; humeral process long and slender; caudal fin
long and deeply forked.</p>


<h3>THE CHANNEL-CATFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Ictalurus punctatus</i>)</h4>

<p>The channel-cat was first described by Rafinesque,
in 1820, from the Ohio River. He named
it <i>punctatus</i>, or "spotted," owing to the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
spots on its sides. It is also known as white-cat
and blue-cat in various parts of its range.
It is found in rivers of the Great Lake region
and Mississippi Valley, and in the streams
tributary to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>It is the most trimly-built of all the catfishes,
with a long, slender body and small head. It is
olivaceous or slate color above, sides pale and
silvery, with small, round, dark spots; belly
white; fins usually with dark edgings.</p>

<p>Unlike most of the catfishes the channel-cat
is found only in clear or swift streams, never in
still, muddy situations. It is a clean, wholesome
fish, and feeds mostly on minnows and crawfish.
It is a good food-fish, the flesh being white and
firm and of a rich flavor. It grows to a weight
of twenty pounds, occasionally, though usually
to five or six pounds.</p>

<p>The channel-cat is a very fine game-fish. It
takes the live minnow readily, also shedder crawfish,
and will not refuse earthworms, cut butcher
meat or liver. When hooked it is second to no
other fish of its size as a bold, strong fighter beneath
the surface. The angler who has "tackled,"
in a literal sense, a channel-cat of five pounds,
on a light rod, can vouch for its gameness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>


<p>As it coexists with the black-bass in streams
in the Mississippi Valley, and is usually taken
by the angler when angling for that fish, the
rod, reel, line, and hook recommended for the
black-bass will be found eminently serviceable
for the channel-cat. It is fond of the deep
pools below mill-dams, and in the channels of
streams off gravelly or rocky shoals, and near
shelving banks and rocks. The method of
casting the minnow for black-bass answers well
for the channel-cat, though the casts should
not be so frequently made, and more time should
be allowed for the display of the minnow in
mid-water.</p>

<p>Still-fishing with a small, live minnow for bait
is the plan generally followed; and as the bait
should be left to its own devices for several minutes
at a time, a light float is sometimes useful for
keeping it off the bottom. When crawfish, cut-bait,
or worms are used, the float must always be
employed for the same reason. The fish should
be given several seconds to gorge the bait, and
then hooked by an upward, short, and quick
movement of the tip of the rod. When hooked
it should feel constantly the strain of the bent
rod, and no more line given than is actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
necessary; otherwise the struggle will last a long
time. No half-hearted measures will answer for
the channel-cat, which has a wonderful amount
of vitality. He must be subdued by the determined
opposition of a good rod and a strong
arm.</p>

<p>There are a number of other catfishes that
are taken by angling, but none are worthy of
the name of game-fishes, though as food they
are nearly all to be commended. There are two
other species of channel-cats, though neither is
quite so good either as game-fishes or for food.
They are the blue-cat, also known as chuckle-head
cat (<i>Ictalurus furcatus</i>), which may be
known by its more extensive anal fin, which has
from thirty to thirty-five rays, and its bluish
silvery color, and with but few if any spots.
The other is the willow-cat, or eel-cat (<i>Ictalurus
anguilla</i>), of a pale yellowish or olivaceous color,
without spots. Both of these fishes are found
in southern waters from Ohio to Louisiana.
The channel-cats are often called forked-tail
cats, as they are the only catfishes that have
the caudal fin deeply forked.</p>

<p>I think no one appreciates the gameness of the
channel-catfish, or has such a just estimation of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
toothsomeness, as the Kentucky darky. He will
sit all day long, a monument of patience, on a log
or rock at the edge of a "cat-hole" of the stream,
with hickory pole, strong line and hook, and a
bottle cork for a float. He baits his hook with a
piece of liver or a shedder crawfish&mdash;"soft craw,"
he calls it, and only uses minnows when the other
baits fail. Apropos of this love for the channel-cat
may be related the true incident of the "cornfield"
darky who, while fishing for cats, had the
luck to hook a fine black-bass, which was landed
after a "strenuous" struggle, to the envy of his
companions. After surveying it with evident
admiration awhile, he unhooked it, and with a
profound sigh he deliberately threw it back into
the stream to the amazement and disgust of the
others. "Good Lawd, Jeff," exclaimed one, "w'at
yo' done do dat fur? dat sholy wa' a good bass;
must a weighed more'n a couple o' poun's!" He
surveyed the group with supreme contempt for a
moment before he replied, "W'en I go a-cattin'.
I go a-cattin'." What greater tribute to the
channel-cat than this!</p>

<p>On the other hand I was once fly-fishing on a
black-bass stream in Kentucky, with a friend from
Ohio who was casting the minnow. Having each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
made a good basket we were ready to quit, as the
evening shadows were lengthening and the air
was becoming decidedly cool. I was taking my
rod apart, but my friend wanted to make "just
one more cast," which happened to be on an
inviting-looking "cat-hole." As I was tying the
strings of my rod case I heard him exclaim joyfully.
"I've got the boss bass of the season!"
Turning, I perceived him wildly dancing on the
edge of the pool, his rod bent to an alarming
curve, and the strain on his line evidently near
the danger point. I watched in vain for the leap
of the bass, and then concluded he had business
on hand for an uncertain period, for I felt sure
that he had hooked a channel-cat of considerable
avoirdupois. The fight was well sustained,
and a gallant one on both sides; but it seemed
impossible for the light rod to bring the fish near
enough to slip the landing-net under it. Finally
he backed away from the stream, drawing the fish
close to the shore, where I netted it&mdash;a channel-cat
of five pounds. When my friend saw what it
was, he was the most disappointed and disgusted
man in Kentucky. "Great Scott!" he yelled.
"I nearly ruined my rod for a confounded catfish."&mdash;"Well,"
said I, "you had your fun; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
put up a good fight; what more do you want?"&mdash;"Want!
want!" he angrily cried, "I want to
stamp the life out of the horrid brute; and I'll do
it, too!" But I unhooked the fish and strung it
on a willow branch. I had it stuffed and baked
for our dinner next day, when he acknowledged
that it was the best fish he ever ate, and was
entirely consoled for the strain to his rod, to say
nothing of his temper, and ever after had a better
opinion of the channel-cat.</p>

<h3>THE SHEEPSHEAD FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Sparidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>This family embraces the sheepshead, porgies,
and sea-breams. It is characterized principally
by a heavy, compressed body, strong jaws and
teeth, the front ones incisor-like and broad, and
flat, grinding teeth or molars in the back of the
mouth, like a pavement of small, rounded pebbles,
for crushing the shells of mollusks.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Archosargus probatocephalus.</i> The Sheepshead. Body short, deep,
and compressed, with large scales; head 3-1/2; depth 2 to 2-1/2;
eye 4; D. XII, 10 or 12; A. III, 10 or 11; scales 8-48-15;
mouth large, nearly horizontal, maxillary 2-2/3 in head; incisors 3/4,
entire in adult; molars in 3 series above and 2 below; gill-rakers
about 3 + 6; dorsal and anal spines notably heteracanthous;
frontal bone between the eyes convex and honeycombed;
occipital crest broad and honeycombed.</p>

<p><i>Stenotomus chrysops.</i> The Scup. Body ovate-elliptical; head 3-1/2;
depth 2; eye 4; D. XII, 12; A. III, 11; scales 8-50-16; profile
steep; nape convex; a strong depression in front of the eye;
snout short; temporal crest obsolete; incisor teeth narrow;
molars in 2 rows above; gill-rakers small, about 6 + 10; caudal
fin forked; top of head, snout, orbitals, and chin naked; a scaly
sheath at base of soft dorsal and anal fins; scales on cheeks.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SHEEPSHEAD</h3>

<h4>(<i>Archosargus probatocephalus</i>)</h4>

<p>In his account of the fishes in the vicinity of
New York, in 1788, Schöpf, a surgeon in the British
army, placed the sheepshead in the European
genus <i>Sparus</i>, but gave it no specific name.
From his description the ichthyologist Walbaum,
in 1792, named it <i>probatocephalus</i>, which being
translated means "sheep head." This fish inhabits
the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Cape
Cod to Texas, where it is common during the
summer months, but it is especially abundant in
the bays of Florida during the entire year. Its
body is nearly half as deep as long, is much compressed,
and elevated and arched over the shoulder.
The head is large, about a third of the
length of the body, with a steep profile, rounded
in front of the eyes, which with its incisor teeth
bears a slight resemblance to the profile of a
sheep. The mouth is large, with strong incisor
teeth in front, and several series of molar teeth
in both jaws. The general tint is dusky gray,
with silvery lustre, paling to the belly; about
half a dozen broad, black bars cross the body,
from above downward, very distinct in the young,
but becoming fainter with age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>


<p>As might be inferred from the character of its
teeth, the sheepshead resorts to mussel shoals,
oyster bars, bridge piers, and old wrecks, where
mussels and barnacles abound, and on which it
feeds, pinching them from their beds with its
strong incisor teeth and crushing them with its
molars. It is gregarious, feeding in schools,
especially in southern waters, several hundred
having been taken on a single tide at places in
Florida. It appears in northern waters in June
and disappears in the fall, probably wintering at
great depths of the sea contiguous to the coast.
Its usual maximum weight in northern waters is
from three to six pounds, though occasionally
reaching ten, fifteen, or even twenty pounds,
though these heavy fish are exceedingly rare. Its
average size in Florida is less than in the North.</p>

<p>It is highly esteemed on the East Coast as a
dinner fish, baked or boiled, and owing to its fine
flavor has been called the turbot of America,
though it is really much superior, in northern
waters, to that vaunted aldermanic delicacy. In
Florida, however, it is very lightly esteemed as
a food-fish, and is seldom eaten where other and
better fishes are available. Perhaps its abundance
has something to do with its depreciation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
though I am convinced, from numerous trials
and tests, that it is not so good a fish in southern
waters as in the North, having a sharp, saline
taste that is not agreeable to most palates.
While confined to salt and brackish waters in the
North, it often ascends the rivers of Florida to
fresh water. I have seen it in the large springs,
the head waters of several rivers on the Gulf coast,
its barred sides being plainly discernible on the
bottom at a depth of fifty or seventy-five feet, in
the clear and crystal-like water.</p>

<p>The difference in flavor between the sheepshead
of the North and South may perhaps be due
to the character of their food. It is especially
noticeable that fishes of the salt water that pass
the winter season in the deep sea, as the salmon,
shad, etc., possess a more superior flavor than
those that feed constantly and during the entire
year along the shores. While nothing is really
known concerning the spawning habits of the
sheepshead in northern waters, it probably spawns
in early summer. From my own knowledge I
can say that it spawns in Florida, on the Gulf
coast, during March and April. Its eggs are
very small, about thirty to the inch, are buoyant
or floating, and hatch in two days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>


<p>A good rod for sheepshead fishing is the
natural bamboo rod, known as the striped-bass
chum rod. It is light, and strong enough to
withstand the vicious tugs, spurts, and especially
the propensity of boring toward the bottom, that
is characteristic of this fish. A rod of steel, or
lancewood, or ash and greenheart, or bethabara,
though heavier, is better and stronger. It should
be about eight feet in length, with double guides.
A multiplying reel carrying sixty yards of braided
linen line, size E or F, Sproat hooks, Nos. 1-0 to
3-0 on gimp snells, with sinkers, and a wide-mouthed
landing-net, make up the rest of the
tackle. The short barb, with cutting edges, of
the Sproat hook renders it superior to the Virginia.
Chestertown, or blackfish hooks formerly
so much in vogue for the sheepshead. A brass
box-swivel is necessary for connecting the line
with the snell of the hook.</p>

<p>While the sheepshead often bites at all stages
of the tide, the most favorable time is about slack
water; from that stage, to half flood or half ebb,
good success may usually be expected. The
largest fish are taken from a boat anchored over
or near mussel shoals or oyster beds. Smaller
ones can be caught from old wharves or bridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
whose piling is studded with barnacles and mussels,
and about which shrimp abound. During
slack water a light sinker is sufficient; but when
the tide runs strongly, heavier ones must be used,
as it is imperative to keep the bait near the
bottom, especially if fishing from a boat. If fishing
from a wharf, it does not matter so much, provided
the bait is deep enough to prevent the fish
from seeing the angler. While this is a precaution
that must be observed with all fishes, I do
not think the sheepshead is so shy a fish as some
maintain; at least I have never found it so.</p>

<p>The best bait is shedder-crab, fiddlers, or
hermit crabs. Clam bait, though, is cheaper
and more universally used in the North. In
Florida the fiddlers can be scooped up by the
peck on the inside beaches of the bays, and
contiguous to good sheepshead fishing. If the
clam is large, the meat should be cut up for
bait; but if quite small, or if mussels are used,
the shells may be merely cracked or smashed,
and put on the hook entire. The latter is the
mode where the fish are scarce or shy, but I
prefer to use the meat only, discarding the shells;
in the case of fiddlers, when very small, they
should be used <i>au naturel</i>, or whole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>The bait should be cast and allowed to sink,
and the line reeled enough to keep the bait
off the bottom, but close to it. A taut line
should be maintained always, so as to feel the
slightest nibble. If crab bait, or cut clam, is
used, the fish should be hooked, if possible, at
the first bite, however slight, by a quick and
somewhat vigorous upward jerk of the tip, otherwise
the sheepshead is apt to nip off the bait;
or if sufficient force is not used, the hook fails
to enter the well-armed mouth. One or other
of these contingencies is almost sure to follow,
if the fish be not hooked. A small sheepshead is
a more adroit stealer of bait than the cunner. It
has a way of deftly pinching the bait from the
hook without much, if any, disturbance. When
small clams or mussels are used in the cracked
shells, it is thought best by some anglers to
give the fish a little time to "shuck" the bait
before jerking on the rod. But my advice is
to yank him just as quickly as if crab bait were
employed. To hesitate is to be defrauded of
either the fish or the bait.</p>

<p>When the fish is hooked he should be kept
from the bottom by the spring of the rod, and
brought as near the surface as possible. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
line is given during his frantic rushes, the spring
and resistance of the rod should never be lessened.
Once on the surface he is easily kept
there until conquered; but if allowed to descend
to the bottom, he is pretty hard to manage, as
his resistance then is very much greater, and he
endeavors to tear out the hook by forcing his
jaws among the rocks and débris or weeds. He
should always be taken into the landing-net, and
care must be observed to avoid his strong and
sharp fins when removing the hook.</p>

<p>In Florida the sheepshead is almost gregarious,
congregating about oyster bars, old wharves, and
near inlets in great numbers. At Colonel Summerlin's
wharf, at Punta Rassa, I knew of a man,
fishing for market, I presume, who took several
hundred on a single tide. The wharf just across
the bay at Sanibel Island is also a famous locality
for sheepshead. The largest I ever caught in
that state was just inside of Little Gasparilla
inlet, near a steep bank on the north side. The
settlers of Florida take them in cast-nets, and the
commercial fishermen in haul seines; the latter
either ship them on ice, or salt them along with
mullet, as they take salt well. With the exception
of the mullet, the sheepshead is the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
abundant fish of both the east and west coasts
of Florida, but it is seldom found in the dense
salt water along the keys at the southern end
of the peninsula, as it is essentially a brackish-water
fish. The angler need never repine for
a lack of sport in the "flowery state" if he is fond
of "sheepsheading," and he will have no difficulty
in securing bait, for the fiddlers are to be found in
myriads convenient to good fishing grounds.</p>


<h3>THE SCUP</h3>

<h4>(<i>Stenotomus chrysops</i>)</h4>

<p>Another fish of the <i>Sparidæ</i> family is the scup,
or porgy, which was first described by Linnæus,
in 1766, from specimens sent to him from South
Carolina by Dr. Garden. He named it <i>chrysops</i>,
or "golden eye." The names scup and porgy are
derived from the Indian name scuppaug. The
porgy is mentioned, like the cunner, in deference
to the ladies and the rising generation of anglers,
to whom it is fair game on the summer excursions
to the seashore. It is confined to the Atlantic
coast from Cape Cod to South Carolina,
being especially abundant in northern waters.
A kindred species, the fair maid (<i>Stenotomus
aculeatus</i>), is common from Cape Hatteras south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>ward,
there taking the place of the northern
scup.</p>

<p>The porgy is a short, deep, and compressed
fish, rather elliptical in outline, its depth being
nearly half of its length, and with the back
elevated over the nape. Its head is of moderate
size, with a steep profile, depressed in front of
the small eye. The mouth is rather small and
the snout short. Its incisor teeth are very narrow
and rather conical or pointed, resembling
canines; there are two rows of molar teeth in
the upper jaw. The color is brownish on the
top of the head and back with greenish and
golden reflections, and bright and silvery below;
the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are dusky or
mottled, and the pectoral fin yellowish.</p>

<p>The scup appears along the shores of the East
Coast about the first of May, sometimes earlier,
and continues until late in the fall, when it retires
to its winter quarters in the depths of the sea. It
is a bottom fish, feeding on crustaceans and small
mollusks, and is found wherever they abound on
the outer shoals. It usually spawns in June; the
eggs are quite small, measuring about twenty-five
to the inch; they are buoyant or floating, and
hatch in four or five days. When perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
fresh it is an excellent pan-fish, its flesh being
firm, white, flaky, and of a fine, sweet flavor, but
owing to its abundance is not properly appreciated.
It grows to a foot or more in length,
weighing a pound or two, though its usual maximum
length is ten inches, and weight half a pound.
Very rarely the oldest fish sometimes reach a
length of fifteen to eighteen inches, weighing
from two to four pounds.</p>

<p>The scup is usually taken by hand-line and
clam bait on the fishing banks from the excursion
steamers; but fishing from small boats
anchored over the shoals, with suitable tackle,
is more sportsmanlike. It is a very free-biting
fish, but is not possessed of much gameness,
though the pleasure of angling for it is much
enhanced by the employment of light tackle.</p>

<p>A trout bait-rod is quite in order for the scup,
though a light natural cane rod about ten feet
long, fitted with reel seat and guides, will answer
a good purpose. A small multiplying reel is not
essential, though it is an advantage in accommodating
the line to different depths; and then a
larger fish than the scup may be hooked. The
line should be of small size, Sproat hooks Nos. 6
to 8 on gut snells, with leader three feet long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
connected to the line by a swivel-sinker, and of a
weight adapted to the strength of the tide. A
float may be used in shallow water to keep the
bait from the bottom when clam or shrimp is
used. In localities where tautog, sea-bass, or
weakfish are likely to be met with, a heavier rod,
like the Little Giant, or a light striped-bass
rod, may be of an advantage to one not accustomed
to lighter rods, and the hook may be a
trifle larger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CUNNER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Tautogolabrus adspersus</i>)</h4>


<p>The cunner was named <i>adspersus</i>, meaning
"besprinkled," by Walbaum, in 1792, from the
description of Schöpf, who simply gave its common
name, burgall, in his "History of New York
Fishes," in 1788. Its specific name is in allusion
to the fancied mottled markings. It belongs to
the <i>Labridæ</i> family. Its habitat is the North
Atlantic coast from Labrador to Sandy Hook,
not appearing much farther south.</p>

<p>The cunner is known by various other names,
as burgall, chogset, blue-perch, etc. It has an
oblong and rather robust body, its depth being
about a third of its length. Its head is about
as long as the depth of the body and pointed,
with a mouth of moderate size, well filled with
unequal, conical, and sharp teeth, in several
series.</p>

<p>The coloration is variable, though usually bluish,
more or less mixed with bronze or brown, with
brassy sides and pale belly; sometimes brassy
spots on the head and back; young examples
exhibit dark blotches and markings. It resorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to the same feeding grounds as the tautog, and
about old wharves and bridges where shrimp and
barnacles abound, and in such situations is always
abundant. It spawns in the early summer, about
June. Its eggs are small, about twenty-five to
the inch, and hatch in four or five days. It
grows to about a pound in weight, though it
usually does not exceed half that amount.</p>

<p>While it is generally considered worthless, or
at best a poor food-fish, it is really a pretty fair
pan-fish, and if it were not so common would be
found oftener on the table of fish lovers. As a
game-fish it is anathema with most anglers. It
is despised because it responds so readily to the
angler's lures, taking the bait intended for larger
and more desirable fish. But on this very account
it is ever dear to the heart of the juvenile
fisherman, who glories in his string of cunners
with as much pride and enthusiasm as his larger
brothers with their tautog, sea-bass, or striped-bass.</p>

<p>It can be caught with almost any kind of tackle
or bait. The cunner has no particular vanity in
the way of either. A piece of liver on an ungainly
hook and twine string is as welcome as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the choicest shrimp on one of Harrison's best
Sproat hooks on a snell of the finest silkworm
fibre. My heart goes out to the boy angler with
his cane pole and cut-bait, fishing for cunners.
And should he in time become the most finished
salmon fisher, he will look back to his cunner
days as conducive of more real pleasure than any
he may have found since. The cunner is here
recorded for the urchin with the cane pole.</p>


<h3>THE FLOUNDER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Pseudopleuronectes americanus</i>)</h4>

<p>There are quite a number of flounders, or flatfishes,
on the East Coast, but the one best known
to juvenile anglers is the one with the long name
recorded above. It belongs to the flatfish family
<i>Pleuronectidæ</i>, and was noticed by Schöpf as early
as 1788, and from his description was named by
Walbaum <i>Pleuronectes americanus</i>, which means,
literally, "the American side-swimmer." It inhabits
the North Atlantic coast from Labrador
to the Chesapeake Bay, and is abundant in all
the bays and estuaries of the Middle states, where
it is variously known as flatfish, flounder, winter
flounder, mud-dab, etc.</p>

<p>Its body is elliptical in outline, about twice as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
long as broad, and very much compressed or flat.
The head is small, less than a fourth of the length
of the body, with a small mouth containing
closely set, incisor-like teeth. As usual with all
of the flatfishes, the dorsal and anal fins are very
long, horizontally, the color on the exposed or
right side is rusty brown, obscurely mottled, with
the under or left side white.</p>

<p>The flounder is partial to sheltered coves and
quiet bays, preferring bottoms of sand or mud,
though sometimes it is found in rocky situations.
It is sedentary in its habits, partially burying
itself in the sand or mud, where it remains during
the entire year, feeding on minute shells, crustaceans,
worms, etc.</p>

<p>It spawns in the spring, during March and
April. The eggs are very small, about thirty to
the inch; and unlike those of most marine fishes
they do not float, but are heavy enough to sink,
forming bunches or clusters on the bottom, adhering
to the weeds, etc., where they hatch in
from two to three weeks. The fry swim upright,
like other fishes, with an eye on each side of the
head, but as they grow older they incline to one
side, the under eye moving gradually to the upper
side, so that at the age of three or four months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
both eyes are on the upper side, as the result
of a twisting of the bones of the head. The
right side, being constantly exposed to the
light, becomes darker or colored, while the
left side, being deprived of light, becomes pure
white.</p>

<p>It is an excellent food-fish, its flesh being firm,
white, and of good flavor; and as it is easily procured
in winter when other fishes are comparatively
scarce, it is a favorite at that season. It
rarely grows to more than a foot in length or a
pound in weight. As it can be caught in early
spring, late fall, and winter, when other fishes are
absent or not inclined to bite, the angler with
light tackle may obtain considerable sport with
this fish, as it will eagerly take almost any kind of
natural bait. A bait-rod used for trout or black-bass
or a light cane rod can be utilized, with very
fine linen line, a three-foot leader, and hooks
Nos. 7 or 8, on gut snells; a reel is not necessary,
but is convenient. Using as light a sinker as possible,
with clam or sandworm bait, the angler may
be assured of success. The fishing may be done
from a boat anchored at low tide on muddy or
grassy flats, or from wharves or piers favorably
located.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE SMELT</h3>

<h4>(<i>Osmerus mordax</i>)</h4>

<p>The smelts were formerly classed with the
salmon family, but are now placed in a separate
one, <i>Argentinidæ</i>, in which are included a number
of allied species. To all external appearances
the smelt is a true salmonid, and differs
from the trouts and salmon chiefly in the form of
the stomach and its appendages. The American
or Atlantic smelt was first described by Dr.
Mitchill, in 1815, from the vicinity of New York;
he named it <i>mordax</i>, or "biting." Its habitat is
along the Atlantic coast from the Gulf of St.
Lawrence to Virginia, but it is most abundant
northward. It is landlocked in a number of
northern lakes.</p>

<p>The smelt is a very pretty, graceful fish, with
a long, slender body, long, pointed head, and large
mouth, with a somewhat projecting lower jaw.
The small adipose fin, which is peculiar to all of
the salmonids, is situated far back, opposite the
end of the anal fin; the caudal fin is deeply
forked. Its color is pale olive-green above, silvery
below, translucent, with an obscure, longitudinal,
broad, satin-like band along the sides. The fins
are greenish, with a few punctulations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>The smelt enters the tidal rivers and brackish
bays in the fall and winter in countless myriads,
preparatory to spawning. It feeds principally on
the small fry of other fishes, mostly at night, and
along the shores in shallow water. It spawns in
March, in both fresh and brackish water. The
eggs are small, about twenty to the inch, and are
adhesive. A medium-sized fish yields fifty thousand
eggs, which hatch in two or three weeks, according
to the temperature of the water, though
usually in from sixteen to eighteen days. Though
small, it is highly prized as a food-fish, having a
delicate and delicious flavor. When fresh it
emits an odor resembling that of cucumbers. Its
usual size is from five to nine inches and weighing
from two to four ounces, though occasionally
reaching a foot or more in length. The smaller
fish are more prized, the largest having a rank
oily flavor. It is caught in large seines by fishermen
and shipped fresh to the markets, and in
winter is taken in great numbers with hook and
line through the ice.</p>

<p>Smelt fishing is a very popular pastime along
the East Coast in the fall and winter, as it is at a
time when not many other fishes are to be caught.
In the inland lakes it is, as has just been men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>tioned,
caught with hook and line through holes
cut in the ice; but this is tame sport compared
with fishing in open water with very light tackle.
The angler can utilize his trout fly or bait-rod, or
if he prefers, a very light natural cane rod eight
or ten feet long. A reel is not necessary. The
line should be of the smallest size, linen or silk,
though silk lines soon rot in salt water. A fine
leader three or four feet long, with hooks Nos. 3
to 6, on single gut snells, are next in order.
When the fish are swimming in schools near the
surface, especially at night, a sinker need not be
used; under other circumstances, and when the
tide is strong, one of suitable weight should be
added. The fishing is usually best on the flood
tide, and almost any kind of bait will answer; but
shrimp is best, though sandworms, very small minnows,
or even earthworms are useful. Given the
proper time and place, and with tackle and bait
in readiness, it only remains to cast the baited
hook, retrieve the fish, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE MACKEREL FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Scombridæ</i>)</h4>


<p>The fishes of this family are all pelagic, and
most of them are highly valued for food. They
are characterized by an elongate body, more or
less compressed; pointed head; large mouth;
sharp teeth; two dorsal fins; the anal and second
dorsal fins are similar in shape and size, and
both are followed by detached finlets; the caudal
fin is widely forked or falcate, its pedicle very
slender and with a sharp keel; scales small and
smooth.</p>

<h3>THE SPANISH MACKEREL</h3>

<h4>(<i>Scomberomorus maculatus</i>)</h4>

<p>The Spanish mackerel was first described by
Dr. Mitchill, in 1815, from the vicinity of New
York. He named it <i>maculatus</i>, or "spotted,"
owing to the large bronze spots on its sides.</p>

<p>It is common to the southern portions of the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the Gulf of Mexico,
ranging in summer as far north as Cape Cod,
and is one of the trimmest and most graceful
fishes known, as well as one of the most beautiful
both in form and coloration. It is especially
adapted for rapid and sustained motion. Its
long, graceful, and elliptical body is four times its
depth. The head is as long as the depth of the
body, with a large mouth, and sharp, lancet-shaped
teeth in both jaws. It has two dorsal fins; the
second dorsal and anal fins are nearly opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
each other, are similar in outline, and are each
followed by nine detached finlets; the caudal fin
is widely forked, the lobes being long and pointed
or crescent-shaped. Its color is silvery, bluish or
greenish above, paling to white on the belly, with
iridescent reflections; the sides are dotted with
some thirty bronze or golden spots, a fourth of an
inch or more in diameter; the first dorsal fin is
dark in front, whitish behind; the second dorsal
is yellowish; the anal fin is pale; the pectoral
fin is yellow, bordered with black; the caudal fin
is dusky.</p>

<p>The Spanish mackerel is gregarious and migratory,
swimming in large schools, and feeding at
the surface on pilchards, anchovies, and sardines
in Florida, and on silversides and menhaden in
northern waters. When feeding, the schools are
constantly leaping above the surface, and the
flashing of their silvery forms in the bright sunlight
is a beautiful and inspiriting sight, enhanced
by the flocks of gulls and terns whirling and darting
above the schools, eager for such stray morsels
and fragments as they are able to seize. In
the Gulf of Mexico it often feeds in company
with the salt-water trout, and in northern waters
with the bluefish and weakfish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a fish of the warm seas, approaching the
shores for spawning and feeding when the temperature
becomes suitable. It appears on the
Gulf coast of Florida in March and April,
though I have observed it as early as January
in forward seasons. Its advent on the Atlantic
coast is later, progressing gradually northward,
reaching the vicinity of New York in July and
August, and disappearing in October or November.
Its breeding season in the Gulf of Mexico
is in the early spring, and as late as August or
September at the northern extent of its range.
Its spawning may cover a period of many weeks,
as the fish do not all mature at one and the same
time. The eggs are quite small, about twenty-five
to the inch, float at the surface, and hatch in
a single day. The newly hatched fry are very
small, about the tenth of an inch long, but in a
year will have attained a length of six inches.
The average weight of a mature fish is from two
to four pounds, rarely exceeding six or eight
pounds.</p>

<p>The Spanish mackerel is held in the highest
esteem as a food-fish, being considered one of the
very best, second only to the pompano of the Gulf
or the whitefish of the Great Lakes. It has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
mackerel flavor, but one peculiarly its own for
richness and sapidity of savor. It is a game-fish
of high degree, and worthy of the angler's highest
regard. Its manner of fighting, when hooked,
is mostly on the surface of the water, darting
here and there with dazzling rapidity, in straight
and curving lines, leaping into air, and bounding
over the water with a velocity and nimbleness
that is difficult to follow with the eye in the
bright sunlight.</p>

<p>In northern waters it is usually taken by trolling
with a small mother-of-pearl squid, or one of
block tin, using a long hand-line, as the fish is
rather shy and difficult to approach with a boat.
In Florida, however, great sport can be had with
a light rod, both in fly-fishing and bait-fishing,
from the sand-spits at the entrance to deep inlets,
and from the long piers and wharves that extend
to deep water. The angling is done in March
and April, when the fish are running into the bays
in great schools on the flood tide, often in company
with the salt-water trout.</p>

<p>A black-bass or trout fly-rod of seven or eight
ounces is very suitable for fly-fishing, with a click
reel and a braided linen line of pretty large size,
say D or E, in order to give weight enough for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
casting. The enamelled silk line is, of course,
better, but it does not last long in salt water.
Any bright or gaudy fly will answer, on hooks
Nos. 1 to 3, though yellowish or grayish flies are
perhaps more attractive. A single fly only
should be used, with a three or four foot leader.
Black-bass rods and tackle are just right for bait-fishing
for the Spanish mackerel, except that a
braided linen line, and not a silk line, should be
used for reasons just given. The best bait is a
small, bright fish, three or four inches long, either
mullet or anchovy, hooked through the lips. A
small pearl squid, or a very small trolling-spoon
or spinner, may be used instead, but the minnow
is far and away the most attractive lure.</p>

<p>The bait is cast as far as possible toward the
school as it is running past the point of an inlet
or the end of a pier, and reeled in slowly, but
rapidly enough to keep the bait on or near the
surface, no sinker being employed. If the fishing
is done from a pier, a very long-handled landing-net
must be provided. The best plan is to fish
from a small boat moored to the pier, as the
angler is not so likely to be seen by the fish, and
they are more easily landed. The same method
is pursued in fly-fishing in the general features,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
except that the fly is allowed to sink after fluttering
it awhile on the surface; no other special
suggestions are needed. I have found the following
flies useful: gray drake, green drake, red
ibis, oriole, professor, and silver doctor, in black-bass
patterns, on hooks Nos. 1 to 3.</p>


<h3>THE CERO</h3>

<h4>(<i>Scomberomorus regalis</i>)</h4>

<p>The cero, or sierra, was described by Bloch, in
1795, from a drawing of a specimen from the
West Indies, by Plumier. He named it <i>regalis</i>,
meaning "royal" or "regal." It belongs to the
West Indian fauna of fishes, and is common from
Florida to Brazil. Occasionally it strays in the
summer as far north as Massachusetts. It is
closely allied to the Spanish mackerel, and resembles
it in form, but differs very much in coloration
and size, being more sombre and much
larger. Its color is brownish on the back, with
silvery sides and belly; it is marked with two
dusky longitudinal stripes, and several rows of
dark spots, not bronze or golden as in the Spanish
mackerel.</p>

<p>I have met with the cero only along the Florida
reefs and keys. It does not swim in such large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
schools as the Spanish mackerel, and does not
accompany it in its wanderings into the bays or
along the shores, but seeks the same localities,
and is of similar habits, as the kingfish-mackerel.
It feeds entirely on fishes. Its breeding habits
have not been studied, though they are doubtless
not unlike those of the Spanish mackerel, except
as to the locality and season of depositing its
eggs. Its usual weight is five or six pounds,
though it sometimes grows to five feet in length
and twenty pounds or more in weight.</p>

<p>I have taken it with bone and block-tin squids,
trolling from a yacht, and also from an anchored
boat with rod and line, by casting mullet or
sardines for bait. A striped-bass rod and tackle
are suitable, as it is a strong and powerful fish,
making extraordinary leaps when hooked. For
its weight I know of no gamer fish, but my experience
in rod-fishing has been somewhat limited,
being confined to the capture of half a dozen fish.</p>

<p>I was once yachting along the Florida keys,
and while anchored near Bahia Honda I put
off in the dinghy to cast mullet bait for cero
and kingfish (<i>Scomberomorus cavalla</i>). The latter
is a near relative of the cero, and they resemble
each other so closely that it is often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
difficult to distinguish between them. The kingfish
is rather more slender, the adult fish being of
a uniform slaty hue, usually without spots or
markings of any kind, and grows to a larger size,
often to fifty pounds or more. It is fully described
in another volume of this series.</p>
<div class="image" id="illo_332">
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_332.jpg">THE BONITO</a></p>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_332.jpg">THE NIGGER-FISH</a></p>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_332.jpg">THE POMPANO</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the occasion referred to I captured a number
of kingfish and two ceros of about the same
relative weight, from eight to ten pounds. The
conditions were quite favorable to compare their
gameness, but I was unable to perceive any difference
in this respect. Both fish took the bait
with a rush, and when hooked exhibited game
qualities of the highest order, leaping continuously
and to a height of five or six feet.
Their swift rushes, as they cut through the water
with incredible swiftness, and for which they are
especially built, were very trying to my light
striped-bass rod. I lost a number of fish that
shook out the hook when leaping. I used the
Sproat bend, No. 7-0, but 5-0 would be large
enough for the average-sized cero. My line was a
braided linen, size E, to which the snelled hook
was attached by a small brass box-swivel; but
knobbed hooks, if they can be obtained of suitable
size, are to be preferred.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The market fishermen of Key West troll for
kingfish and cero in their schooner smacks, using
coarse hand-laid cotton lines, and codfish or other
large hooks as mentioned. The bait is usually
a piece of white bacon-rind, cut in an elliptical
shape to resemble a fish, and strung along the
shank of the hook, and fastened at the top by a
piece of fine copper wire. This rude device is
very successful, as they take hundreds of fish in a
few days, of a size running from ten to fifty
pounds. The cero and the kingfish are favorite
food-fishes in Key West, where large quantities
are consumed; and years ago many were
carried to Havana by the smacks, until a prohibitive
duty was imposed by the Spanish governor-general,
in order to favor Spanish fishermen.
Under the changed conditions that now exist in
Cuba this trade will doubtless be resumed. Both
the cero and kingfish are excellent food-fishes,
with a flavor much like that of the Spanish mackerel,
but more pronounced,&mdash;that is, not so delicate
and delicious, but more pungent.</p>

<p>Northern anglers who go to Florida in quest
of the tarpon will find in the cero and kingfish
game-fishes of great merit on light tackle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE BONITO</h3>

<h4>(<i>Sarda sarda</i>)</h4>

<p>The bonito is a very handsome and gamy fish
belonging to the mackerel family. It was named
<i>sarda</i> by Bloch, in 1793, from its being taken in
the vicinity of Sardinia. It inhabits both coasts
of the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea.
It is not uncommon from the region of Cape Cod
southward to Florida and the West Indies, where
it is more abundant.</p>

<p>It has a long, graceful body, nearly round, its
depth a fourth of its length. It is elliptical in
outline, tapering to a very slender caudal pedicle,
which is strongly keeled. The mouth is large,
with strong, conical teeth. The caudal fin is
deeply forked, or swallow-like. Its color is dark
steel-blue above, silvery below, with white belly.
There are numerous dark oblique stripes running
from the back downward and forward, by which
it is easily recognized. The ventral fins are
whitish, the other fins are bluish black.</p>

<p>The bonito is a pelagic fish, approaching the
shores in search of food, which consists of small
fishes almost entirely. It grows to a length of
three or four feet, though it is usually taken of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
ten or twelve pounds in weight. It does not
rank high as a food-fish, having rather dark flesh
of a strong mackerel flavor, rather too pungent to
be agreeable, but it is liked generally by sailors.
There is another fish of the Atlantic coast
(<i>Gymnosarda pelamis</i>), of the mackerel family,
that is known as the oceanic bonito. It may be
distinguished by its stripes being horizontal,
instead of oblique; it is rather rare.</p>

<p>The bonito is taken only by trolling with a
small fish for bait, or a block-tin, bone, or shell
squid, from a sailing vessel, and with bluefish
tackle. It is frequently caught by the Key West
fishermen when trolling for kingfish with a bait
of bacon-rind. It is a powerful fish, and withal a
very game one, being a swift swimmer, and must
be handled very carefully when hooked. The
line should be a heavy one of braided linen or
cotton, and a foot or two of brass or copper wire
should be used as a snell to withstand its sharp
and numerous teeth. A Sproat or O'Shaughnessy
hook, No. 7-0, is about right when bait is
used, and one of similar size with artificial squids,
or spinners.</p>

<p>I was once trolling in the vicinity of the Dry
Tortugas, and in a short time took four bonitos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of about twelve pounds each. As the yacht was
going at a spanking rate with a beam wind, the
strain on the line was tremendous, and in each
case the vessel had to be luffed up into the wind
to enable me to land them. As one fish was
more than enough for the crew, and as I had
occasion to land at Fort Jefferson, on Garden
Key, I resolved to donate the others to the garrison
of the fortress. On going ashore I found
the "garrison" to consist of one man, the corporal
in charge of the property. He said he did not
think he alone could get away with the fish, but
as the lighthouse keeper of the fort would return
from Loggerhead Key in the afternoon, he thought
that they, together with his dog, might manage
to dispose of them. Afterward he informed me
that he and the light-keeper had finished one
bonito, and the dog, whose name was Bonaparte,
had made way with the others, or as he expressed
it: "Bone eet two," and said this without any
intent to pun on bon-i-to; he thought that I was
amused at the capacity of Bonaparte as an ichthyophagist,
being unconscious of his play on the
words which caused my merriment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE GAG</h3>

<h4>(<i>Mycteroperca microlepis</i>)</h4>

<p>The gag is one of the series of fishes known
as groupers in Florida, of which there are quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
a number. It was first described by Goode and
Bean, in 1879, from West Florida; they named
it <i>microlepis</i>, or "small scale," as its scales are
of less size than the other species of the same
genus. It is known only from the South
Atlantic coast and the Gulf of Mexico, from
North Carolina south to Pensacola.</p>

<p>It has a rather long, shapely body, with pointed
head and an evenly curved profile. Its mouth
is large, with projecting lower jaw. Both jaws
are armed with narrow bands of sharp teeth and
two canines, the upper ones directed forward.
The predominating hue of the gag is brownish
or brownish gray, with lighter sides, in deep-water
specimens; those of shallow water, especially
in grassy situations, are greenish or olivaceous,
mottled with a darker shade, and more or
less clouded. Very small and indistinct dusky
spots sometimes cover the entire body, and a
faint mustache is usually present. The dorsal
fin is olive; the top of the soft dorsal fin rays
is darker, with white edge; the caudal fin is
bluish black, with white edge. It is a voracious
fish, feeding on small fishes and crustaceans, and
grows to a large size; twenty or thirty, or even
fifty, pounds in weight is not uncommon, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
usually taken of from six to ten pounds. It
resorts, when large, to the banks and rocky reefs
in deep water. Those of less size frequent the
inshore waters. It is a fine food-fish, and a very
game one on the rod.</p>

<p>A light striped-bass rod, or the natural bamboo
chum rod, with good multiplying reel and
fifty yards of braided linen line, size E, and
Sproat or O'Shaughnessy hooks, Nos. 3-0 or 4-0,
on gimp snells, with a brass box-swivel for connecting
snell and line, and a sinker adapted to
the strength of the tide, make up the tackle for
the gag. A large landing-net or a gaff-hook
should not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Rod fishing is done in comparatively deep
water on the rocky reefs or shelly banks along
the keys, from an anchored boat. Any natural
bait, as a small fish, crab, crawfish, or conch, will
answer, though a small fish, as the mullet, sardine,
or anchovy, is the best. When of large
size the gag is a very gamy fish, and must be
handled very carefully to preserve one's tackle
intact.</p>

<p>It is taken more frequently by trolling with a
strong hand-line from a sailing yacht, in the
same way as trolling for bluefish. A small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
silvery fish is the best lure, though a strong
spinner or a shell or block-tin squid answers well.
Even a piece of bacon-rind cut in the semblance
of a fish proves very attractive, in the manner
commonly used by the fishermen of Key West in
trolling for the kingfish.</p>

<p>The largest groupers can be taken on rocky
bottom in the deep holes about the inlets. On
the southeast coast, Indian River Inlet, under
the mangroves, and Jupiter Inlet, both afford
good grouper fishing. Farther south, at Hillsboro
and New River inlets, and in the deep
holes about the passes between the Florida Keys,
from Cape Florida to Key West, groupers are
more or less abundant. The first gag I ever
caught was in the winter of 1877, while trolling
off Cape Florida; it was a big one, too, weighing
about fifty pounds. "What is it?" asked a
Kentucky boy who was with me. I was compelled
to look it up in my books before replying
that I thought it was a "scamp," as it agreed
pretty well with the description of that grouper,
though I was not fully satisfied that my identification
was correct, and less so, when in about
an hour we caught a real scamp. This was
some two years before the gag was described as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
a new species by Drs. Goode and Bean, from
Pensacola. As I had no means of preserving
the fish, it was baked for our dinner, and proved
to be very good indeed.</p>

<p>In fishing for groupers the angler must keep
them well in hand so as to prevent their getting
into the holes and crevices of the rocks, as they
are sure to do if given the chance, and from
where it is almost impossible to dislodge them.
They should be brought to the surface, or near
it, as soon as possible after hooking them, and
kept there until ready for the landing-net or
gaff-hook. Most people in Florida fish for
groupers with hand-lines, but with the tackle
recommended the fish will be more easily subdued
and landed, and the pleasure much enhanced,
to say nothing of the question of sportsmanship
as between the two methods.</p>


<h3>THE SCAMP</h3>

<h4>(<i>Mycteroperca falcata phenax</i>)</h4>

<p>The scamp is a grouper that resembles very
much the gag. It was first described by the
Cuban ichthyologist Poey, in 1860, from Cuban
waters. He named it <i>falcata</i>, or "scythe-shaped,"
from the curving of the caudal fin. The form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
common to Florida is a variety or subspecies,
that differs principally in the angle of the canine
teeth and to some extent in coloration. The
variety was first described by Jordan and Swain, in
1884, who named it <i>phenax</i>, meaning "deceptive,"
and equivalent to "scamp." It is abundant along
the Florida Keys and the offshore "snapper
banks," from Key West to Pensacola; those of
smaller size frequent inshore waters.</p>

<p>It resembles the gag very much in its general
appearance and in the shape of its body, with a
somewhat larger mouth and more projecting lower
jaw, also a larger caudal fin, which is more
crescentic or scythe-shaped. The depth of its
body is about a third of its length. The teeth
are in narrow bands, with two canines in each
jaw, but these are not so strong as in the Cuban
form, and those in the upper jaw are not directed
so much forward, nor the lower ones so much
backward. The caudal fin is concave or crescentic,
and the scales are larger than those of
the gag. The color is pinkish gray above, paler
purplish gray below; the upper part of the body
and head is covered with small, rounded, irregular
dark brown spots; the sides and caudal fin with
larger and longer pale brownish blotches, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>what
reticulate; fins dusky, some edged with
white. Its habits are similar to those of the gag,
just described, in whose company it is found.
It grows to a length of two feet or more, and
to ten pounds or more in weight. The remarks
concerning the tackle and fishing for the gag
apply equally as well for the scamp.</p>

<p>This fish, with the gag, is sometimes taken on
the snapper banks by the red-snapper fishermen,
though it is not shipped to the northern markets
as it does not bear transportation so well as the
red-snapper, and is sold for home consumption or
eaten by the crews. I first saw this fish as has
just been related, in 1877, when it was caught by
a Kentucky friend, and it had very much the same
appearance as the gag. We then decided that
both fish were scamps, my friend remarking that
"The only difference is that this fellow seems to
be more of a scamp than the other one," an
opinion I fully indorsed. The scamp does not
stray so far north as the gag, being confined to
subtropical regions. It is regularly taken to the
Key West market by the commercial fisherman,
where it commands a ready sale, being well
esteemed as a food-fish. The first specimens I
afterward preserved were secured from this source.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE YELLOW-FINNED GROUPER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Mycteroperca venenosa</i>)</h4>

<p>This grouper was first noticed by Catesby, in
1743, from the Bahamas, and was named by
Linnæus, in 1758, who bestowed the specific title
<i>venenosa</i>, or "venomous," as its flesh was said by
Catesby to be poisonous at certain times. It is
common at the Bahamas, and from the Florida
Keys southward to the West Indies, and perhaps
to South America. Its form is very similar to
the gag and scamp; its depth is a third of its
length. Its head is as long as the depth of the
body, and rather blunt, with the profile somewhat
uneven, but curved; the mouth is large, with
narrow bands of teeth, and two canines in each
jaw which are not directed forward.</p>

<p>Not much is known concerning this fish, as its
flesh is reputed to be poisonous at times, and it
is seldom eaten.</p>

<p>Its coloration is quite varied and beautiful; it
is olive-green on the back, pearly bluish below,
breast rosy. The upper parts are marked with
broad reticulations and curved blotches of bright
light green, which are especially distinct on the
top of the head; the entire body and head are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
covered with orange-brown spots of various sizes
with dark centres; the iris of the eye is orange, as is
the inside of the mouth; the dorsal fin is olive-brown,
with whitish blotches and a few dark
spots; the pectoral fin is yellow, and all other fins
have black edges. Its habits are similar to those
of the other groupers. It grows to three feet in
length, and frequents rocky situations.</p>


<h3>THE ROCK HIND</h3>

<h4>(<i>Epinephelus adscensionis</i>)</h4>

<p>This grouper is one of the most bizarre and
gayly colored in the family <i>Serranidæ</i>. It was
first accurately described by Osbeck, in 1757,
from Ascension Island, which accounts for its
specific name, <i>adscensionis</i>, as bestowed by him.</p>

<p>It is very widely distributed over both hemispheres,
being known from Ascension and St.
Helena Islands, Cape of Good Hope, and is
abundant from the Florida Keys to Brazil. In
outline it resembles the other groupers, having
a robust body, but little compressed; its depth is
a third of its length, its head is as long as the
depth of the body, is pointed, with a profile
straight from the snout to the nape, thence curved
regularly to the tail. The mouth is large, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the lower jaw more prominent or projecting than
in any of the other groupers; the teeth are in
broad bands, with short and stout canines.</p>

<p>Its ground color is olivaceous gray, with darker
clouds; the head and entire body are profusely
covered with red or orange spots of varying size,
those on the lower part of the body the largest,
nearly as large as the pupil of the eye; parts of
the body and fins have irregularly-shaped, whitish
spots or blotches; there are several ill-defined,
clouded, blackish, vertical, or oblique blotches
across the body, some of them extending upward
on to the dorsal fin, with the interspaces lighter;
the fins are likewise spotted with red and white.</p>

<p>The groupers known as "hinds," as the red,
rock, brown, speckled, spotted, or John Paw hinds,
are so named from being spotted, and resembling
somewhat in this way the hind or female red deer.
They are all good food-fishes, and are found
regularly in the Key West market, though not
so plentiful as the snappers, grunts, etc., but
bringing a better price. The rock hind, as might
be inferred from its name, frequents rocky situations
about the channels between the keys,
feeding mostly on small fishes and marine invertebrates.
It grows to a length of eighteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
inches. Its spawning habits have not been
studied, though it probably spawns in the spring.</p>

<p>A light bait-rod, similar to a black-bass rod,
with corresponding tackle, with hooks Nos. 2-0
to 3-0, on gimp snells, will answer for this fish,
using sardines or anchovies, which are abundant
along the shores, for bait.</p>


<h3>THE RED HIND</h3>

<h4>(<i>Epinephelus guttatus</i>)</h4>

<p>This beautiful grouper rivals the rock hind in
its gay and varied coloration. There is some
uncertainty about the correct specific name of
this well-marked species. The last name to be
adopted is <i>guttatus</i>, meaning "spotted," conferred
by Linnæus in 1758, based on the early and
vague descriptions of Marcgrave and others on
specimens from Brazil and the West Indies. It
belongs to the West Indian fauna, its range extending
from the Florida Keys to South America;
it occasionally strays north in the summer
to the Carolina coast.</p>

<p>It resembles the other groupers in its general
form, but is more slender, has a larger eye, and
its lower jaw does not project so much. The
depth of its body is a little more than a third of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
length. Its head is long and pointed, considerably
longer than the depth of its body, with a mouth
of moderate size, and a weak lower jaw, which projects
but slightly; the eye is very large; the teeth
are in bands, with two curved canines in each.</p>

<p>The pattern of the coloration and the markings
are similar to those of the rock hind, but differ
in color. The upper part of the body is grayish
or yellowish olive, the belly reddish; the entire
head and body are profusely covered with scarlet
spots of nearly uniform size, except those on the
breast and belly, which are a little larger; there
are a few spots, both red and whitish, on the bases
of the fins; there are three broad, oblique, obscure
bands running upward and backward on the sides,
extending on to the dorsal fin; the upper fins are
edged with black; the pectoral fin is reddish yellow.</p>

<p>The red hind, like the rock hind, frequents
rocky places and feeds mostly on small fishes.
It grows to a length of about eighteen inches,
and is an excellent food-fish. Not much is known
concerning its breeding habits, though it probably
spawns in the spring. The same tackle recommended
for the rock hind, and the same baits,
will do as well for the red hind, as they are found
together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE CONEY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Petrometopon cruentatus</i>)</h4>

<p>This beautiful fish is allied to the groupers,
and belongs to the family <i>Serranidæ</i>, previously
described. It was described and named by Lacépéde
from a drawing by Plumier, made from a
specimen from Martinique. Lacépéde recorded
it in his "Natural History of Fishes," 1803,
conferring on it the name <i>cruentatus</i>, meaning
"dyed with blood," in allusion to its red spots.
It belongs to the West Indian fauna, with a range
extending from the Florida Keys to Brazil; it is
quite common about Key West, being seen in
the markets every day.</p>

<p>The body has the somewhat elliptical outline
of the other groupers, but is more oblong and
deeper, its depth being more than a third of its
length. The head is moderate in size, rather
pointed, its length less than the depth of the
body; the mouth is large, with the lower jaw projecting
but slightly; the teeth are in narrow
bands, the inner series long, slender, and depressible;
the canines small. Its ground color is
reddish gray, a little paler below; the head and
body are covered with bright vermilion spots,
larger and brighter anteriorly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>
<div class="image" id="illo_354">
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_354.jpg">CATCHING SPANISH MACKEREL ON THE EDGE OF THE GULF STREAM</a></p>
</div>

<p>It frequents rocky situations, like the coney of
Holy Writ. It is highly esteemed as a food-fish,
but is of smaller size than the groupers previously
described, seldom growing beyond a foot in
length or a pound in weight. It probably spawns
in the spring. It is quite a gamy fish for its size
on light tackle.</p>

<p>It is usually taken by the market fishermen on
the same tackle as the grunts, snappers, porgies,
etc., among the rocks of the channels, in rather
deep water, with fish bait. It is well worth catching,
if only to admire its graceful shape and brilliant
coloration.</p>

<p>For the coney, black-bass rods, braided linen
line, size F, with Sproat hooks, No. 2-0 or 3-0,
on gimp snells, and sinker adapted to the strength
of the tide, with the smallest fish for bait, will
answer admirably. The little whirligig mullet,
or spiny crawfish, or even cut-fish bait, are all
good baits to use as occasion may demand.</p>


<h3>THE NIGGER-FISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Bodianus fulvus</i>)</h4>

<p>It is difficult to account for names, we know;
but just why this handsome fish should be called
"nigger-fish" is hard to imagine. It is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
called yellow-fish, a better and more descriptive
name, but no doubt nigger-fish it always
will be. It differs from the other groupers in the
less number of spiny rays in the dorsal fin; otherwise
it is much the same. It was described by
Linnæus, in 1758, from the account of the "yellow-fish"
by Catesby, in 1743, from the Bahamas.
Linnæus named it <i>fulvus</i>, or "tawny," from its
coloration. This is also a fish belonging to the
West Indian fauna, its range extending from the
Bahamas and the Florida Keys to South America.</p>

<p>The outline of body of the nigger-fish is similar
to that of the hinds, being nearly elliptical, and
with a depth of a third of its length, and moderately
compressed. The head is long and pointed,
longer than the depth of the body, with an evenly
curved profile from the snout to the dorsal fin;
the lower jaw projects very much; the mouth is
large, with narrow bands of teeth, and small
canines. Its general color is yellow, darker or
orange-red on the back, with two black spots on
the tail; there are a few violet spots about the
eye, and some blue spots on the head and anterior
half of the body, those on the head with dark
margins; the head, and pectoral and dorsal fins,
are reddish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>The nigger-fish is found in the deeper channels
in rocky situations. It feeds on small fishes principally.
It is not very common, and is much
prized as a food-fish by the people of Key West.
The common varieties are the red and brown
nigger-fishes, which differ only in coloration from
the yellow ones. It is taken with the other
channel fishes, and with the same baits and
similar tackle, by the market fishermen; but the
angler should utilize his black-bass rod, with
braided linen line, size F, and hooks No. 2-0
on gimp snells. As it is a bottom feeder a sinker
must be used to keep the bait at the proper
depth. For baits, any small fish or sea-crawfish
or prawns or shrimps will answer.</p>

<p>I was once fishing for channel fishes in sight
of Key West, and having just landed a nigger-fish.
I asked my boatman, a Bahama negro,
why it was so called. He answered in the
lingo peculiar to both white and black Bahamians:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vell, maybe it's along of its yaller and red
color, for niggers is right fond of yaller and red;
but vether that's the horigin of its fust name is
'ard to tell. Now, Hamericans calls us Bahama
people conchs 'cause we eats conchs, but nigger-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>fish
don't eat niggers, no more does jellyfish eat
jelly. I think they are called nigger-fish 'cause
they is so 'andsome."</p>


<h3>THE SAND-FISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Diplectrum formosum</i>)</h4>

<p>The sand-fish, or, as it is sometimes called, the
squirrel-fish, also belongs to the family <i>Serranidæ</i>.
It was first described by Linnæus, in 1766, from
Dr. Garden's specimens from South Carolina; he
named it <i>formosa</i>, or "handsome," from its pretty
form and coloration. It inhabits the Atlantic
coast from South Carolina to South America,
and is common to both coasts of Florida, and
especially about the keys. It has a rather elliptical
body in outline; its depth is less than a third
of its length, being elongate and rather slender
as compared with other allied species. The
head is as long as the depth of the body, with an
arched profile above the eyes; the mouth is large,
the lower jaw projecting a little; the upper border
of the cheek-bone is serrated, with two clusters
of small, sharp spines; the teeth are in narrow
bands; the canine teeth are small.</p>

<p>Its color is light brown above, silvery white
below; there are several dark and broad ver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>tical
bars across the body, and a dark blotch
at the base of the caudal fin; the body has
eight narrow bright blue longitudinal stripes,
which are more distinct above, and paler below;
the head is yellow, with several wavy blue stripes
below the eye and several between the eyes;
the upper fins have blue and yellow stripes, and
the caudal fin has yellow spots surrounded by
bluish markings.</p>

<p>It frequents sandy shoals, and also rocky
shores, feeding on small fishes and crustaceans.
It is a good pan-fish, growing to about a foot
in length, but usually to six or eight inches.
The same tackle and baits used for the hinds,
coney, and nigger-fish will also answer well for
the sand-fish, which consists of black-bass rod,
braided linen line, size F, hooks No. 1 or 1-0, and
suitable sinker and swivel. It is a good game-fish
for its size on the light tackle just mentioned,
and is well worth a trial on account of its beauty,
and excellence for the table, even if its gameness
is not considered.</p>

<p>While engaged in a scientific expedition to
Florida many years ago, my vessel ran aground
one afternoon in Barnes Sound, southwest of
Biscayne Bay. The bottom was a sandy marl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and quite soft, so that we were unable to use the
setting poles to any advantage in moving the
boat. I observed quite a school of fish surrounding
the vessel, which proved to be sand-fish. I
put out a stake to mark the stage of the tide, and
while waiting for the flood tide I put in the time
fishing, and soon had enough sand-fish for supper
and breakfast. This was rather fortunate, as we
were still aground the next morning, for strange
to say the depth of the water had neither increased
nor diminished for sixteen hours; there
was no tide in that remote corner of the universe.
We then took out the ballast of about a ton of
pig-iron and put it in the dory we had in tow.
This lightened up the vessel enough to enable us
to shove her off into deeper water. I think we
never enjoyed any fish quite so much as those
delicious little sand-fish, and it has ever since
been one of my favorite fishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CAVALLI FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Carangidæ</i>)</h4>


<p>The members of this family differ from the
true mackerels by a less number of spines in the
first dorsal fin, and in having but two spines in
the anal fin, and no detached finlets; also in having
smaller teeth. Some of the species are described
in another volume of this series, to which
the reader is referred.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Carangus chrysos.</i> The Runner. Body oblong, moderately elevated,
the dorsal and ventral outlines about equally arched; head 3-3/4;

supplemental bone; dorsal and anal fins falcate, anterior
rays nearly reaching middle of fins when depressed; dorsal lobe
4-1/2 in body; anal 5-1/2; dorsal lobe pale.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE RUNNER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Carangus chrysos</i>)</h4>

<p>The runner was first described by Dr. S. L.
Mitchill, in 1815, from the vicinity of New York.
He named it <i>chrysos</i>, meaning "gold," from the
golden sheen of its sides. It inhabits the
Atlantic coast from Cape Cod to Brazil, but is
most abundant on southern shores and in the
Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>It has an oblong body, its depth a little less
than a third of its length, with the dorsal and
ventral curves about equal. The head is shorter
than the depth of the body, with a uniformly
curved profile and rather sharp snout. The
mouth is moderate in size and low, with a single
series of teeth in the lower jaw, and two in the
upper one, but no canines; there are also small
teeth on the roof of the mouth and tongue. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
colour is greenish olive on the back, and golden
yellow or silvery below; there is a black blotch
on the border of the gill-cover; the fins are all
plain.</p>

<p>The runner, as its name indicates, is a great
forager, and is the swiftest and most graceful of
all the jacks or cavallies. It ranges farther
northward than the other species of the genus.
It frequents the reefs and the shores of the keys
and mainland of Florida in search of food, which
consists of small fishes, as sardines, anchovies,
mullets, etc., crustaceans, and other small organisms.
It is the best of the jacks as a food-fish,
and is in great favor at Key West. For its
size it is also the gamest, but as it rarely exceeds
a foot in length it is not so much sought, generally,
as the larger jacks. It is, however, a great
favorite with the juvenile anglers at Key West,
as it can be taken from the wharves with almost
any kind of bait. On account of its activity and
gameness it furnishes fine sport on light tackle,
and under these conditions is worthy the attention
of the angler. A light black-bass rod,

outfit for the runner, which is also known as
hard-tail and jurel in some localities. About
Key West and the neighboring keys the best
bait is the little whirligig mullet (<i>Querimana
gyrans</i>), which whirls on the surface in large
schools, or cut bait or shrimps may be used to
advantage.</p>

<p>The author of a recently published book on
the fishes of Florida makes the following queer
statement, "It seems to me the runners are
hybrids from the crevalle and bluefish species or
families, as they certainly resemble both of those
fishes." It would be strange did they not resemble
the fishes named, as all are of the mackerel
tribe, and all are distinguished by having falcate
anal and dorsal fins of about the same relative
size, and placed about opposite each other, and
also have swallow-shaped caudal fins with slender
caudal pedicle; but there the greatest resemblance
ends. I have never seen a hybrid among fishes
in the natural state. They can be produced by
the fishculturist between kindred species, but
there is no especial benefit to be derived from
such experiments. Hybrids, or so-called mules,
are infertile, and incapable of reproducing their
kind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE HORSE-EYE JACK</h3>

<h4>(<i>Carangus latus</i>)</h4>

<p>The horse-eye jack was first described by
Louis Agassiz, in 1829, from Brazil, who named
it <i>latus</i>, or "broad," owing to its short and deep
form. It differs from the runner mostly in being
deeper in body, and in its large eye. It has a
few less soft rays in the dorsal and anal fins, and
but thirty-five bony scutes along the lateral line;
otherwise it is very similar. Its color is bluish
above and golden or silvery below, and it has a
black spot on the margin of the gill-cover, but of
less size than that of the runner. While it is
similar in habits to the runner, it has a more
extended range, inhabiting all warm seas.</p>

<p>The horse-eye jack grows to a larger size than
the runner, but is not nearly so good a food-fish,
though nearly its equal as a game-fish. Its flesh
is reputed to be poisonous at certain seasons in
the tropics, and whether true or not, it is not held
in much favor, though it is caught by boys at
the wharves of Key West, and I presume is
eaten. The same tackle and baits recommended
for the runner can be utilized for the horse-eye
jack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE POMPANO</h3>

<h4>(<i>Trachinotus carolinus</i>)</h4>

<p>The pompano was first described by Linnæus,
in 1766, from Dr. Garden's specimens from South
Carolina, which accounts for its specific name.
It is abundant on the South Atlantic and Gulf
coasts, to which it is mostly confined, though it
occasionally strays north to Cape Cod in summer,
and rarely to the West Indies.</p>

<p>It has a short, deep body, being nearly half as
deep as long, oblong and robust. Its head is
short, about half as long as the depth of the
body, with a small, low mouth, and with few or
no teeth in the jaws; the snout is blunt, the
profile from end of snout to the eye about vertical,
and from thence to the dorsal fin is regularly
arched. The color is bluish above and golden
or silvery below; the pectoral and anal fins are
yellow, shaded with blue; caudal fin with bluish
reflections.</p>

<p>The pompano frequents the sandy beaches of
the keys and islands of the Gulf coast, mostly
the outside shores, where it feeds on beach-fleas
and the beautiful little mollusks known as "pompano-shells,"
also on small shrimps and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
shore-loving organisms. I consider the pompano
to be the best food-fish in either salt or fresh
water&mdash;the prince of food-fishes, it is incomparable.
It is caught principally in haul seines
by the fishermen on the flood tide. On the
Atlantic coast it is abundant at Jupiter inlet
and at Lake Worth, but not so plentiful as about
the outside and inside beaches of the islands
about Charlotte Harbor on the Gulf coast. In
the summer it strays northward to the Carolina
coasts. Its usual weight is a pound or two,
rarely exceeding eighteen inches in length or
four pounds in weight. It is often confounded
with several other species, as the permit (<i>Trachinotus
goodei</i>), which reaches three feet in
length and twenty-five or thirty pounds in
weight; also with the gaff top-sail pompano
(<i>Trachinotus glaucus</i>), and the round pompano
(<i>Trachinotus falcatus</i>), both of which grow larger
than the true pompano and are often sold for the
genuine article by dealers; but no one who has
eaten a true pompano can be deceived by these
other species. It spawns in the summer.</p>

<p>It is difficult to take the pompano with the
hook except on the flood tide, when it is running
in schools, feeding along the shores, though it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
occasionally caught by still-fishing in the bays
with bait of beach-fleas or cut clam. The tackle
should be very light and the hook small, Nos. 6
or 8, on fine gut snells. When hooked it is a
game-fish of more than ordinary cunning and
cleverness, and one of two pounds will tax the
angler's skill on a six-ounce rod. They can be
taken in the surf of the outside beaches of the
islands, on the flood tide, with beach-flea bait, by
casting it into the schools with a fly-rod; and this
is the best form of fishing for this grand fish.</p>

<p>The hooked pompano frequently breaks water
among its other man&oelig;uvres to escape the angler,
and as a leaper at other times has quite a reputation.
I have often had them leap into my boat,
both when anchored and moving, but usually
when sailing near a school. The name pompano
is probably derived from the Spanish word
<i>pampana</i>, a "vine leaf," owing to its shape
resembling somewhat a leaf of some kind of
vine; the books say a "grape leaf," to which the
pompano has a remote resemblance if the
extended fins are taken into account. There is
another Spanish word <i>pampano</i>, more nearly
resembling pompano in sound and spelling. It
means "a young vine branch or tendril," and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the aquatic capers and aerial saltations of the
pompano when hooked are to be brought into
the comparison, they cannot be exceeded by that
most intricate dance, the "grape-vine twist," even
when performed by the most agile plantation
negro. But seriously, when its size is considered,
one would have to go far afield, or rather
search the waters under the earth, for a better
fish for the angler or the epicure.</p>

<p>I have seen more pompano about the beaches
of Big and Little Gasparilla Keys of Charlotte
Harbor, on the Gulf coast, than elsewhere in
Florida. On their outside beaches, during the
flood tide, the beach-fleas and pompano-shells
come rolling in on every wave. The little mollusks
disappear beneath the sand in the twinkling
of an eye, but the crustaceans are again carried
out by the receding wave. And this continues
during the first half of the flood tide, during
which time schools of pompano are feeding on
them. On one such occasion myself and a friend
were "flea-fishing" for pompano; that is, we were
using fly-rods and very small hooks baited with
beach-fleas, which we cast in the same manner
as artificial flies. My friend, fishing at the
water's edge, often forgot in his eagerness to step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
back to avoid each "ninth wave," which would
wet him to his knees. However, in that warm,
sunny clime the involuntary bath did him no
harm, and he had his compensation in a basket
of fine pompano, which were duly planked for
dinner and eaten, bones and all,&mdash;for their bones
are very soft and semi-cartilaginous. The head
of a broiled or planked pompano is a <i>bonne-bouche</i>
that once eaten will ever be held in
grateful and gratified remembrance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CHANNEL FISHES</h3>


<p>The channels among the reefs and keys from
Cape Florida to Key West and vicinity abound
with a number of percoid, or perchlike, fishes,
belonging to several families. They are mostly
of small size, comparatively, but afford good
bottom fishing. They are all good food-fishes
and find a ready sale in the markets of Key
West. Most of them are remarkable for their
gay and brilliant coloration.</p>

<p>The coralline formation of the keys and reefs
renders the use of seines and nets impossible,
so that all of the fishing for market is done with
hook and line,&mdash;usually with sea-crawfish bait,
though a few are taken in traps formed of heavy
wire. The fishes consist of grunts, snappers,
groupers, porgies, etc., and are carried to market
alive in the wells of the small vessels known as
"smackees."</p>

<p>A fleet of larger vessels, mostly schooner-rigged,
troll along the keys and reefs for the larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
surface-feeding fishes, as kingfish, cero, Spanish
mackerel, bonitos, large groupers and snappers,
etc. The troll is usually a piece of bacon-skin
cut of an elliptical shape to simulate a fish, and
is impaled on a codfish hook with a snell of
copper wire, and a laid cotton codfish line of a
size nearly as large as a lead-pencil. The hooking
and hauling aboard of the fish, while under
sail, so disables it that it is killed by a blow on
the head and carried to market on ice.</p>

<p>As all of the grunts, snappers, porgies, and
other channel fishes grow only to a foot or two
in length, the same tackle may answer for all.
The fishing is done in water of varying depth,
from a few feet to twenty or more, from an
anchored boat. The best plan for the angler
who is visiting Key West for the first time is
to go out with a market fisherman in his boat
and learn by ocular evidence the <i>modus operandi</i>
of channel fishing. After that he will be prepared
to follow his own devices and fish in the
same or an improved way.</p>

<p>A stiffish black-bass rod, or the Little Giant
rod of seven and one-half feet and eight ounces,
a modification of the Henshall black-bass rod,
are quite suitable, though the market fishermen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
use hand-lines altogether. The rest of the tackle
needed is a multiplying reel, a braided linen line,
size E or F, Sproat or O'Shaughnessy hooks of
various sizes, from Nos. 1 to 3-0, according to
the size of the mouths of the different fishes,
though No. 1-0 will be found to be a good
average size. Sinkers of different weights, from
one to six ounces, to meet the strength of the
tide, and a strong landing-net must be added.
The hooks should be tied on single, strong silkworm
fibre.</p>

<p>The best bait is the sea-crawfish (<i>Palinurus</i>),
or spiny lobster, which grows to the size of the
common lobster, and is found in the crevices of
the coral reefs or among the rocks and shells
at the bottom, from whence it is taken by the
fish spear called "grains." The flesh is taken
from the shell and cut up for bait, and the shell
itself is tied to a line and sunk near the bottom
to attract the fish. Shrimps are also good bait,
as are any of the small fishes, or conchs cut into
suitable sizes. Any of the various crabs can
also be utilized. The large conchs <i>Strombus</i> and
<i>Pyrula</i> are good, and a large one will furnish bait
for a whole day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>


<h3>BAIT FISHES</h3>

<p>For the information of anglers who would
like to know something of the small fishes used
for bait, their names at least, I think it not out
of place to mention them here. The mullet is
one of the fishes most frequently utilized. There
are several species belonging to the family
<i>Mugilidæ</i>: the common mullet (<i>Mugil cephalus</i>),
the white mullet (<i>Mugil curema</i>), both of which
are abundant in Florida, especially the first
named. There is a somewhat rare species along
the coasts, but common at Key West, the fan-tail
mullet (<i>Mugil trichodon</i>). A very abundant
but very small species, and one that makes
a capital bait for fishes with small mouths, is the
whirligig mullet (<i>Querimana gyrans</i>).</p>

<p>There are several species of sardines belonging
to the herring family (<i>Clupeidæ</i>). They may
be found in all bays along the coasts, going in
and out of the inlets with the tide. The most
common species are the silver sardine (<i>Sardinella
humeralis</i>), which has a dark spot at the
base of the pectoral fin, and the striped sardine
(Sardinella sardina), which has faint streaks
along the sides.</p>

<p>The anchovies belong to the family <i>Engrauli</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
<i>didæ</i>, and may be distinguished by their very
wide mouths, which open back to the gill-cover.
The species all look very much alike; the most
common ones are the banded anchovy (<i>Stolephorus
perfasciatus</i>), with narrow silvery longitudinal
band, and from two to three inches long;
the big anchovy (<i>Stolephorus brownii</i>), which is
deeper and grows larger, from four to six inches
in length; these two species are mostly confined
to the south and west coasts. Another
species, also abundant on the east coast, is the
silver anchovy (<i>Stolephorus mitchilli</i>), which is
more silvery or translucent in appearance than
the others, with yellowish fins and dotted body.</p>

<p>There are a number of crabs that are excellent
baits, as the hermit crab (<i>Eupagurus</i>), which
lives in the cast-off shells of univalve mollusks;
fiddler crab (<i>Gelasimus</i>), which abounds in myriads
on the inside shores of the bays; the spider
crab (<i>Libinia</i>), which is quite common in shallow
water, sometimes covered with bits of weeds,
shells, etc.; the common crab (<i>Cancer</i>); the lady
crab (<i>Platyonichus</i>), beautifully spotted; the stone
crab (<i>Menippe</i>), quite a large crab, with very
large claws; the mud crab (<i>Panopeus</i>), a small
crab and a very good bait. There are a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of crustaceans, commonly called beach-fleas, that
are good baits for small-mouthed fishes along
the Florida coasts, among which may be mentioned
the beach-flea (<i>Orchestia</i>); the sand-bug
(<i>Hippa</i>); the gribble (<i>Limnoria</i>); also the shrimp
(<i>Gammarus</i>); and the prawn (<i>Palæmonetes</i>).</p>


<h3>THE GRUNT FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Hæmulidæ</i>)</h4>

<p>The grunts have an oblong body, more or less
elevated and compressed; head large, its sides
usually scaly; mouth low and horizontal, usually
curved; sharp or pointed teeth; dorsal fin single,
with a marked angle at the junction of the spiny
and soft portions; the dorsal spines ten or twelve;
anal fin with three spines, the second one the
largest; caudal fin concave. The coloration is
bizarre and usually brilliant, with the lips and
inside of the mouth bright red or scarlet. They
are all good pan-fishes, and from their habit of
emitting vocal sounds when caught are called
"grunts." They feed on crustaceans, small fishes,
and the innumerable marine invertebrates that
inhabit the coral reefs and coralline rocks.</p>

<h3>THE BLACK GRUNT</h3>

<h4>(<i>Hæmulon plumieri</i>)</h4>

<p>The black or common grunt is the most abundant
and one of the most popular food-fishes in the
vicinity of Key West. It was named by Lacépéde,
in 1802, in honor of Father Plumier, an early naturalist,
who sent drawings of the fishes of Martinique
to the museums of Europe. It belongs to
the West Indian fauna, and is abundant near Key
West, and not uncommon about the rocks and
reefs at the lower end of Tampa Bay and other
rocky localities on the Gulf coast of Florida. On
the Atlantic coast it is found as far north as Cape
Hatteras.</p>

<p>The depth of the body is a little more than
a third of its length, compressed, with elevated
shoulder. The head is as long as the depth of
the body, with a large, curved mouth and a
pointed and projecting snout. The profile is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
concave in front of the eye. The jaws are armed
with bands of strong and conical teeth, the outer
ones largest and the rear ones curving forward.
Its color is bluish gray, with the bases of the
scales bronze, tinged with olive, forming oblique
stripes running upward and backward. The head
is golden bronze, with many bright blue stripes,
very distinct, a few of which extend to the shoulder.
The inside of the mouth is scarlet, becoming
lighter, or yellowish, on the jaws. The dorsal
fin is grayish, with a yellow border on the spinous
portion; the anal fin is gray tinged with yellow;
the ventral fins are bluish gray; the pectoral fins
are gray with a dusky bar at the base; the caudal
fin is plain gray.</p>

<p>The common grunt grows usually to a foot in
length, though more are caught under that size
than over. It is often called "sow grunt" by the
market fishermen, in contradistinction to the "boar
grunt," as the yellow grunt is often designated by
them, wrongly supposing one to be the male and
the other the female. While the general remarks
on its feeding habits, as given in the paragraph
relating to the family characteristics of the grunts,
are correct, it may be stated that they are essentially
carnivorous, devouring small fishes, crusta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>ceans,
and other marine invertebrates that abound
on the coralline reefs. They spawn late in the
summer, on the rocky shoals and hard, sandy bars,
congregating at such times in large schools. As
a food-fish it is held in greater esteem than any
other fish in the Key West market, and selling
from a nickel to a dime for a bunch of about half a
dozen, it forms the staple breakfast dish of all
Key Westers, who are inordinately fond of it.</p>

<p>While assistant chief of the fisheries department
of the World's Columbian Exposition at
Chicago, in 1893, I had among other visitors a
young lady friend from Key West, who never
before had been away from her island home, having
been educated at the convent of Key West.
She could not find words to express her delight
at scenes so entirely new and novel, and said that
some things gave her a better idea of heaven;
but there was one thing, she said, that was lacking
amidst all the wonders and delights from the
four quarters of the globe, and without which
everything else paled into insignificance,&mdash;"fried
grunts for breakfast." I made her happy by escorting
her to the Aquarium and showing her the
live grunts swimming in a tank, seemingly as
much at home as on the coral reefs of Florida.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
The methods of angling, and the tackle and baits
used for grunts, are given in the opening paragraphs
of this chapter, to which the reader is
referred.</p>


<h3>THE YELLOW GRUNT</h3>

<h4>(<i>Hæmulon sciurus</i>)</h4>

<p>The yellow grunt was first noticed by Bloch,
in 1790, from the West Indies; but owing to a
mistake as to its proper identification it was
named <i>sciurus</i>, meaning "squirrel," by Shaw, in
1803, based on Bloch's description and figure.
The name squirrel is in allusion to the grunting
noise it emits when captured, which is compared
to the barking of that animal. It is
abundant in the West Indies and south to Brazil,
and is quite common about Key West.</p>

<p>The yellow grunt is very similar to the common
grunt in the conformation of its body and
fins, but has a rather curved profile instead of a
depression in front of the eye. The teeth are similar,
with about three strong canines on each side.
The scales on the upper part of the body are relatively
smaller than in the black grunt. Its color
is uniformly brassy yellow, with about a dozen
longitudinal and distinct stripes of sky-blue, somewhat
wavy, extending from the snout to the anal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
fin; the fins are yellowish; the inside of the mouth
is scarlet. It grows to about a foot in length,
but occasionally to eighteen inches. It is the
handsomest in coloration and appearance of all
the grunts, and is often called "boar grunt" by
the Key West fishermen. A black-bass bait rod,
braided linen line, snelled hooks No. 1-0, with
sinker adapted to the depth and current of the
water, and sea-crawfish, shrimps, prawns, or cut-fish
bait, will be found quite applicable for grunt
fishing.</p>

<p>Although the yellow grunt was known to science
from the West Indies as early as 1790, it
was not recorded from the waters of the United
States until a century later, when in 1881 I collected
it at Key West. This is the more remarkable
inasmuch as it is rather common along the
keys, and is moreover such a striking, well-marked,
and handsome species that it is difficult
to imagine how it had been overlooked. The
field has, however, been pretty well worked since,
and many new species have been recorded.</p>

<p>The Florida Keys, like the southern portion of
the peninsula, are of recent formation, and are
underlaid by oolitic and coral limestones. These
coralline rocks are formed by the action of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
waves and weather on the calcareous secretions
of coral polyps, those beautiful "flowers of the
sea" which are still building better than they
know on the outlying submerged reefs, and where
may be seen those tiny "toilers of the sea,"
madrepores, astreans, mæandrinas, porites, gorgonias,
etc., rivalling in beauty of form and color
the most charming and delicate ferns, fungi,
mosses, and shrubs.</p>

<p>The fishes that frequent the coral reefs are very
handsome, both in form and coloration: silvery,
rosy, scarlet, brown, and golden bodies, with sky-blue,
bright yellow, rosy, or black stripes and
bands, or spotted, stellated, and mottled with all
the hues of the rainbow; and with jewelled eyes
of scarlet, blue, yellow, or black; fins of all colors
and shapes, and lips of scarlet red, blue, or silver.</p>


<h3>THE MARGATE-FISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Hæmulon album</i>)</h4>

<p>The margate-fish, or margate grunt, is the
largest of the family, growing to two feet or more
in length and eight or ten pounds in weight,
though usually it weighs from two to six pounds
as taken to market. It was noticed by Catesby
in his "History of the Carolinas," in 1742, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
wrongly identified from his description by Walbaum
in 1792. It received its present name from
Cuvier and Valenciennes, in 1830, from West
Indian specimens; they called it <i>album</i>, meaning
"white," as it is the lightest in coloration of any
of the grunts. It is much esteemed as a food-fish
at Key West. It is abundant from Key
West to Brazil, being quite common about the
Florida Keys, especially in the immediate vicinity
of Key West, being usually found in deep water,
except when it approaches the shallows to feed
on crustaceans, etc. It is rather a warm-water
fish.</p>

<p>The margate-fish is of much the same proportions,
and of similar appearance, as the yellow
grunt, but with a more elevated and arching
back, and is more compressed. The teeth are in
narrow bands, and are somewhat smaller than in
the other grunts. The adult fish is whitish, olivaceous
on the back, with faint spots on the scales
of back and sides. The inside of the mouth is
orange; the lips and snout yellowish; the fins
dusky greenish; a broad but indistinct band extends
along the sides. Younger fish are bluish
in coloration of body and fins, with dark parallel
stripes below.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhat larger hooks, say No. 2-0, and a
little heavier line, braided linen, size F, are more
suitable for this fish; otherwise the same tackle
and baits can be employed as for the other grunts
and channel fishes.</p>


<h3>THE SAILOR'S CHOICE</h3>

<h4>(<i>Hæmulon parra</i>)</h4>

<p>This grunt is sometimes called bastard margaret
by the Key West fisherman. The name
sailor's choice is often wrongly applied to the pin-fish
(<i>Lagodon rhomboides</i>) and the pig-fish (<i>Orthopristis
chrysopterus</i>) The sailor's choice was
first described by Desmarest, in 1823, from Havana;
he named it <i>parra</i> in honor of the Cuban
naturalist, Parra. It is a good pan-fish, eight or
ten inches long, usually, but sometimes growing
to a foot in length. It is abundant from Key
West to Brazil. I have taken it from the line of
keys southwest of Cape Florida, and along the
mainland from Biscayne Bay to Marco and Lemon
Bay on the Gulf coast.</p>

<p>Its body is of about the same proportions, and
of the same general appearance, as that of the
yellow grunt, and it grows to about the same
size. The radial formula of its fins and size of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
scales are also much the same. The mouth is
smaller, but the teeth are of about the same character.
Its color is dull pearly gray, belly grayish,
each scale of the body with a distinct olive-brown
spot, forming interrupted, oblique, and wavy
streaks; fins dusky. The inside of the mouth is
not so red as in the other grunts. There is a
distinct black spot on the lower edge of the
cheek-bone.</p>


<h3>THE GRAY GRUNT AND FRENCH GRUNT</h3>

<p>The gray grunt (<i>Hæmulon macrostomum</i>) and
the French grunt (<i>Hæmulon flavolineatum</i>) are
not so common about the Florida Keys as the
other grunts, but grow to about the same size, and
are often taken with them, and with the same
baits and the same mode of fishing.</p>


<h3>THE PIG-FISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Orthopristis chrysopterus</i>)</h4>

<p>Another pan-fish belonging to the grunt family
and common to the waters of Florida, and one
much esteemed as a food-fish, is the pig-fish. It
is known as hog-fish in Chesapeake Bay, and
sailor's choice on the South Atlantic coast. It
was described by Linnæus, in 1766, from South
Carolina. He named it <i>chrysopterus</i>, or "gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
fin." Its range extends from the Chesapeake Bay
along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts to Florida
and Texas, and occasionally it strays as far north
as Long Island.</p>

<p>It resembles the grunts very much in its general
appearance. Its body is rather more than a
third of its length, elevated at the shoulder, and
compressed. Its head is a third of the length of
the body, with a long, sharp snout and a small
mouth placed low. There is a narrow band of
slender teeth in each jaw, the outer ones in the
upper jaw somewhat larger. The color of the
pig-fish is light blue above, shading gradually to
silvery below; the upper lip is marked with blue;
the body scales have a blue centre, the edges with
a bronze spot, forming very distinct orange-brown
stripes along the rows of scales on the back and
sides, those above the lateral line extending
obliquely upward and backward, those below being
nearly horizontal; the snout, cheeks, and
gill-covers have distinct bronze spots, larger than
those of the body; the inside of the mouth is pale,
the back of the mouth somewhat golden in hue;
the dorsal fin is translucent, with bronze spots or
shades, the edge of the fin dusky; the other fins
are more or less dusky, with yellowish shades.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts it resorts
to sandy shoals in rather shallow water, but along
the Florida Keys it is found also about rocky
bars, and on the Gulf coast is often on grassy
flats, or wherever crabs, shrimp, beach-fleas, and
other crustaceans abound, on which it feeds, principally,
though it is also fond of the young fry of
other fishes. It is an excellent pan-fish, of delicious
flavor, and is a favorite wherever its merits
are known. It grows to a length of ten inches,
sometimes to twelve or fifteen inches in favorable
localities, but in Florida is mostly from six to
eight inches in length. It spawns in the spring
in April and May.</p>

<p>It is much sought after in Chesapeake Bay, and
is a favorite food-fish at Norfolk, Virginia, where
it is known as hog-fish. It grows there somewhat
larger, and is also a favorite fish with anglers.
The lightest tackle must be employed for
its capture, and hooks Nos. 2 to 3, on gut snells,
for it has a small mouth. Sea-crawfish, crab,
shrimp, beach-fleas, and other crustaceans are
the best baits, though cut conch and fish will
answer pretty well. It is a bottom feeder, and
sinkers must be used to keep the bait near the
fish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE PORK-FISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Anisotremus virginicus</i>)</h4>

<p>Another pan-fish of the grunt family (<i>Hæmulidæ</i>)
is the pork-fish, a handsome and beautifully-marked
species. It was named by Linnæus, in
1758, from South America, though why he called
it <i>virginicus</i>, "Virginia," is not known. It is a
tropical fish, its range extending from the Florida
Keys to Brazil. It is very abundant in the vicinity
of Key West, and is seen in the markets daily.</p>

<p>It has a short, compressed body, its depth being
half of its length, with the back very much
elevated. Its head is short compared with its
height, with a very steep profile, slightly convex
in front and very much arched at the nape. The
mouth is quite small, with thick lips; the jaws
are armed with bands of sharp, pointed teeth, the
outer row enlarged. The ground color of the
body is pearly gray; an oblique black bar, as
wide as the eye, extends from the nape through
the eye to the angle of the mouth; another
broader and jet-black vertical bar extends from
the front of the dorsal fin to the base of the pectoral
fin; the interspace between the bars is
pearly gray, with yellow spots, becoming conflu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>ent
above; beginning at the vertical bar and
extending backward are half a dozen deep yellow,
longitudinal, and parallel stripes, the lower ones
reaching the caudal fin; all of the fins are deep
yellow.</p>

<p>The pork-fish resorts to the reefs and coralline
rocks, feeding on crustaceans, small marine invertebrates,
and small, soft-shelled mollusks, which it
crushes with the blunt teeth in its throat. Its
usual size runs from half a pound to a pound, but
occasionally grows to two pounds. It should be
fished for with very light tackle, about the same
as used for the pig-fish, but with smaller hooks.
No. 5 or 6, on gut snells, and cut-conch bait,
small shrimps, and beach-fleas.</p>

<p>The pork-fish has been known from the time
of Marcgrave, over two centuries ago, from Brazil,
and from the West Indies for many years, but
was not recorded from the waters of the United
States until 1881, when I collected it near Key
West. As in the case of the yellow grunt and
the lane snapper, it is surprising that such long-described
and well-marked and beautiful species
should have been overlooked in our own waters
until my collection of that year.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE SNAPPER FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lutianidæ</i>)</h4>

<p>This family of perchlike fishes is related to the
grunts on one hand, and to the groupers, or sea-basses,
on the other. Those to be described here
are mostly of small or moderate size, but are all
good food-fishes and fair game-fishes. They are
abundant along the Florida Keys, and with the
exception of the red snapper are caught in a
similar manner, and with the same tackle and
baits, as the grunts. They are characterized by
an oblong body more or less elevated and compressed;
rough scales, large head and mouth;
teeth sharp and unequal; dorsal fin single, with
ten or twelve spines; anal fin similar in shape to
soft dorsal fin, with three spines; the caudal fin
concave.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Ocyurus chrysurus.</i> The Yellow-tail. The yellow-tail differs from
the other snappers in the formation of the skull, the peculiar
form of its body, the large, deeply-forked caudal fin, and the
presence of pterygoid teeth. Its body is elliptical, with regularly-arched
back; head 3; depth 3; scales 7-65-15; D. X, 13;

<h3>THE YELLOW-TAIL</h3>

<h4>(<i>Ocyurus chrysurus</i>)</h4>

<p>The yellow-tail is a very handsome fish, and
one of the favorite pan-fishes at Key West. It
was named <i>chrysurus</i>, or "gold-tail," by Bloch,
in 1790, from its description by Marcgrave in his
"Fishes of Brazil." Its habitat is from southern
Florida to South America. It is abundant in the
vicinity of Key West in the channels between
the reefs and keys.</p>

<p>The yellow-tail is well proportioned, compressed,
and elliptical, being regularly curved from head to
tail. Its head is as long as the depth of the body,
with a pointed snout; the mouth is rather small,
with the lower jaw projecting. The color above is
olivaceous, or bluish, below violet; a broad, deep
yellow stripe runs from the snout, through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
eye, and along the middle of the body to the
caudal fin; above this stripe there are a number
of deep yellow blotches, as if made by the finger
tips; below the broad yellow stripe are quite a
number of narrow, parallel yellow stripes, with
violet interspaces; the iris of the eye is scarlet;
the very long caudal fin is entirely deep yellow,
and the other fins are bordered with yellow.</p>

<p>The yellow-tail associates with the grunts and
porgies about the coralline rocks in the channels,
feeding on small fishes and crustaceans. Its
average size is ten or twelve inches in length
and nearly a pound in weight, though it sometimes
is taken up to two feet, and three or four
pounds. It is quite a good game-fish and very
voracious, eagerly taking sea-crawfish, crab, conch,
or small fish bait. Some of the large conchs, as
<i>Pyrula</i> and <i>Strombus</i>, will furnish bait for an
entire outing, the animal being as large as a
child's forearm. Black-bass tackle, with hooks
Nos. 1 to 1-0 on gut snells, will answer for the
yellow-tail.</p>


<h3>THE LANE SNAPPER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lutianus synagris</i>)</h4>

<p>The lane snapper is another beautiful fish common
about the reefs and keys. It was named by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Linnæus, in 1758, who called it <i>synagris</i>, as
it resembled a related fish of Europe (<i>Dentex
dentex</i>), whose old name was <i>synagris</i>. Catesby
mentioned the lane snapper in his "History of
Carolina," in 1743. It is abundant from the
Florida Keys to South America, and not uncommon
on the west coast of Florida, as far north as
Tampa Bay, and west to Pensacola.</p>

<p>The lane snapper resembles very much the
yellow-tail in the shape of its body, which is semi-elliptical
in outline, compressed, with the back
regularly curved from the snout to the tail; its
depth is a little more than a third of its length.
Its head is as long as the depth of the body; the
mouth is large, and the snout pointed. It is rose
color, tinged with silver below, with a narrow
bluish or greenish border on the top of the back;
the belly is white, tinged with yellow; there are
deep yellow stripes along the sides, with indistinct,
broad, rosy cross bars; the iris of the eye
and the lips are scarlet; the cheeks and gill-covers
are rosy, with blue above; the pectoral fins
are pink, the lower fins yellow, the soft dorsal
pink, the spiny dorsal translucent, with yellow
border, and the caudal fin scarlet; there is a large
and conspicuous dark blotch just below the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
part of the soft dorsal fin. The lane snapper
feeds on small fishes and crustaceans about the
keys and reefs, in rather shallow water. It grows
to a foot in length, though usually about eight
or nine inches, and is a free biter at the same baits
as the yellow-tail.</p>

<p>While it is freely conceded that the highest
branch of angling is casting the artificial fly on
inland waters, and that the fullest measure of
enjoyment is found only in the pursuit of the
salmon, black-bass, trout, or grayling, it must be
admitted that salt-water angling likewise has joys
and pleasures that are, as Walton says, "Worthy
the knowledge and practice of a wise man." And
nowhere does salt-water angling offer more
charms to the appreciative angler, or appeal to
his sense of the curious and beautiful in nature,
than along the keys off the southern extremity
of the peninsula of Florida. The palm-crowned
islets are laved by the waters of the Gulf Stream,
as clear and bright and green as an emerald of
the purest ray serene. Through their limpid
depths are seen the lovely and varied tints of
coral polyps, the graceful fronds of sea-feathers
and sea-fans in gorgeous hues, and the curious
and fantastic coralline caves, amid whose cran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>nies
and arches swim the most beautiful creations
of the finny tribe, whose capture is at once a
joy and a delight.</p>


<h3>THE RED SNAPPER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lutianus aya</i>)</h4>

<p>The red snapper was named <i>aya</i> by Bloch, in
1790, that being the Portuguese name for it in
Brazil, according to Marcgrave. It was described
by Goode and Bean as a new species, in 1878, and
named <i>blackfordi</i>, in honor of Eugene G. Blackford,
of New York, in consideration of his eminent
services and interest in fishculture. The red
snapper, while not a game-fish, is one of the best
known of Florida fishes, inasmuch as it is shipped
all over the country as a good dinner fish, its
fine, firm flesh bearing transportation well. It is
especially abundant in the Gulf of Mexico, in
water from ten to fifty fathoms deep, on the
"snapper banks," from ten to fifty miles offshore,
and thence south to Brazil, occasionally straying
north on the Atlantic coast to Long Island.</p>

<p>The depth of its body is a little more than a
third of its length, being rather deep and compressed,
the back elevated and regularly arched
from the eye to the tail. The head is large, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
length equal to the depth of the body, with a
pointed snout, large mouth, and straight profile.
The color of the red snapper is a uniform rose-red,
paler on the throat; fins all red, the vertical
fins bordered with dusky blue; there is a dark
blotch under the front of the soft portion of the
dorsal fin, except in the oldest and largest fish;
the iris of the eye is scarlet.</p>

<p>The red snapper, being a deep-water fish, is
seldom found along the shores, and is of no importance
to the angler. It is a bottom fish, feeding
in company with the large groupers on small
fishes and crustaceans. It grows to twenty or
thirty pounds, but its usual size is from five to
ten pounds. It spawns in summer.</p>

<p>The commercial fishing for the red snapper
is done on the "snapper banks" in very deep
water. Strong hand-lines and codfish hooks are
used, with cut bait. By the time the fish is
brought to the surface from the bottom it is
almost exhausted, and would afford no sport to
the angler. The bringing of the fish from depths
where the pressure of the water is so great, to the
surface, where it is comparatively so much less,
causes the fish to swell up, and the air-bladder to
be so filled that the fish would float; it is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>fore
pricked with a sharp awl to let out the air,
as otherwise the fish would not sink in the well
of the vessel in which it is carried alive to port.</p>


<h3>THE DOG SNAPPER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lutianus jocu</i>)</h4>

<p>The dog snapper is very similar in shape to
the red snapper, but is much smaller and of different
coloration. It was named <i>jocu</i> by Bloch,
in 1801, from Parra's description, in 1787, <i>jocu</i>
being the Cuban name of the fish. It is called
dog snapper, owing to its large canine teeth. Its
range extends from the South Atlantic coast to
Brazil. It is abundant along the Florida Keys,
and very rarely strays along the Atlantic coast
northward, but has been taken on the Massachusetts
coast in summer.</p>

<p>It has a robust, somewhat compressed body,
its depth a third of its length, and the back
elevated over the shoulder. Its head is large,
somewhat longer than the depth of the body,
with a straight profile and a rather long and
pointed snout. The ground color of the body
is dull red or coppery, dark olivaceous or bluish
on the back, with about a dozen lighter-colored
vertical stripes across the body; the cheeks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
gill-covers are red, with a pale area from the eye
to the angle of the mouth; there is a row of small,
round blue spots from the snout to the angle of
the gill-cover, also a bluish or dusky stripe; the
upper fins and the caudal fin are mostly orange
in color; the lower fins are yellow, and the iris of
the eye red.</p>

<p>The dog snapper, like the other snappers, feeds
on small fishes and crustaceans. It grows to a
foot in length and to a pound or two in weight.
It is a good food-fish, selling readily in the markets.
It is quite gamy and voracious, and with
light tackle is worthy of the angler's skill. Hooks
No. 1-0 or 2-0 on gut snells, and sea-crawfish,
or a small minnow, are good baits.</p>


<h3>THE SCHOOLMASTER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lutianus apodus</i>)</h4>

<p>The schoolmaster snapper was named by Walbaum,
in 1792, based on Catesby's description and
figure of the schoolmaster in his "History of Carolina,"
but in his figure he omitted the pectoral fins,
for which reason Walbaum named it <i>apoda</i>, meaning
"without a foot." Its range extends from
the Florida Keys to Brazil, and is abundant in
the vicinity of Key West, where it is seen daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
in the markets. Under favorable conditions of
temperature it has been taken on the Massachusetts
coast.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster is very similar to the dog
snapper in its general form, but differs greatly in
coloration. Its body is rather deep and compressed,
its depth being more than a third of its
length, and the back is more elevated than in the
dog snapper. The head is large, as long as the
depth of the body, with a large mouth; the profile
is straight from snout to the nape, thence
regularly arched to the tail; the snout is long
and pointed. The predominating color is orange,
olivaceous on the back and top of the head, with
eight or nine vertical bars across the body, equidistant,
of a pale or bluish white color, the wider
interspaces being red; the cheeks and gill-covers
are red, with a row of small blue spots from the
snout across the cheeks, just below the eye; all
of the fins are yellow, more or less shaded with
red.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster grows to about the same size
as the dog snapper, usually from eight to ten
inches, sometimes to a foot in length, and a
pound or two in weight. It feeds on small
fishes, crabs, and other crustaceans, and is a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
food-fish. It is a fairly good game-fish, and on
light tackle fights with vigor and considerable
resistance. Sproat hooks Nos. 1-0 and 2-0 are
quite suitable, and should be tied on gut snells.
A sinker adapted to the strength of the tide must
be used in the deep-water channels. Sea-crawfish,
anchovies, or whirligig mullets are good
baits.</p>

<p>The mangrove snapper (<i>Lutianus griseus</i>)
and the mutton-fish (<i>Lutianus analis</i>) are larger
snappers and better game-fishes. They are
described in another volume of this series.</p>


<h3>THE PORGY FAMILY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Sparidæ</i>)</h4>

<p>The porgies of Florida belong to the family
<i>Sparidæ</i> previously described, but not to the
same genus as the northern porgy, as the scup is
sometimes called. They are characterized by a
deep, compressed body, humpbacked, with a large
head and deep snout, and with a knob in front of
the eye. The mouth is small, with strong, caninelike
teeth and molars.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Calamus bajonado.</i> The Jolt-head Porgy. Body oblong, compressed
and elevated over the shoulders; head 3; depth 2-2/5;
eye 3; scales 7-54-17; D. XII, 12; A. III, 10; anterior profile
evenly curved; mouth moderate, maxillary not reaching front</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>of eye; snout long and pointed; teeth strong, conical; anterior
teeth enlarged, 2 or 3 on each side in the upper jaw, and 3 or 4
on each side in the lower; molars in 3 series in the upper, and
2 in the lower jaw; dorsal fin single with slender spines.</p>

<p><i>Calamus calamus.</i> The Saucer-eye Porgy. Body oblong, elevated
more than the other porgies; head 3-1/3; depth 2; eye 3-3/4; scales
9-54-16; D. XII, 12; A. III, 10; anterior profile steep; outline
of snout slightly curved; mouth small, maxillary not reaching

<h3>THE JOLT-HEAD PORGY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Calamus bajonado</i>)</h4>

<p>This is the largest and most abundant of the
porgies. It was described by Bloch, in 1801,
who named it <i>bajonado</i>, after the Cuban name
given by Parra in his "Natural History of Cuba."
It is not certain what the name is intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
signify. It may allude to the "bayonet-like,"
interhæmal bones, or to <i>bajio</i>, meaning a "sandbank"
or "shoal," in allusion to its habitat. The
jolt-head is abundant along the Florida Keys,
especially in the vicinity of Key West, where it
is one of the commonest market fishes; its range
extends to the West Indies.</p>

<p>It has a short, deep body, compressed, its depth
being half its length; its back is more regularly
arched than in the other porgies, or not so humpbacked.
The head is large, with a long, pointed
snout, and mouth moderate in size; the profile is
more regularly curved than in the other porgies.</p>

<p>The predominating color is dusky or bluish,
with brassy reflections; the upper fins are pale or
bluish, more or less mottled with darker shades;
the lower fins are plain; the cheeks are coppery
in hue.</p>

<p>The jolt-head resorts to the rocks and reefs,
as well as to hard, sandy shoals, feeding on small
fishes, crustaceans, and soft-shelled mollusks. It
grows usually to eight or ten inches, but often
to two feet in length, and six or eight pounds in
weight. It is a good food-fish, much in favor
with the people of Key West, and is always one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
of the commonest fishes in the markets. It
spawns in the summer. It is very voracious,
taking almost any kind of bait greedily. It is
caught in company with the grunts and snappers,
and on the same tackle, which should be light.
Hooks Nos. 1 to 2 are large enough, Sproat-bend
preferred on account of its short barb with cutting
edges and strong wire. Sinkers adapted to the
tide and depth of water must be used.</p>
<div class="image" id="illo_410">
<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_410.jpg">TAKING BONITO BY TROLLING OFF BLOCK ISLAND</a></p>
</div>

<p>While catching porgies at a lively rate one day
I asked my boatman, a Bahama negro, why the
big porgy was called "jolt-head." He answered
in the cockney dialect peculiar to Bahama fishermen:
"Vell, you see, sir, 'e 'as a big 'ed and an
'ump back, and 'e butts the rocks like a billy-goat,
a-joltin' off the snail-shells and shrimps, and 'e
goes a-blunderin' along like a wessel that 'as a
bluff bow and a small 'elm. 'E 'as more happetite
than gumption, and swallers anythink that comes
'andy, like the jolt-'ed or numbskull that 'e is.
'E is werry heasy to ketch and werry good to
heat."</p>


<h3>THE SAUCER-EYE PORGY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Calamus calamus</i>)</h4>

<p>This porgy is called "saucer-eye," owing to its
having a larger eye than the other porgies. It
was first described by Cuvier and Valenciennes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
in 1830, from the West Indies. They named it
<i>calamus</i>, meaning "quill" or "reed," from the quill-like
bones (interhæmal) that articulate with the
spines of the anal fin. It is abundant in the West
Indies, and is common about the Florida Keys,
but not so plentiful as the jolt-head or little-head
porgies.</p>

<p>It is very similar in conformation to the jolt-head,
but is more humpbacked, being quite
elevated above the shoulder. The body is short,
its depth about half its length. Its head is short
and deep, with a thin and gibbous profile, and
small mouth. Its color is silvery with bluish
reflections; the scales golden, forming longitudinal
stripes, with pearly-bluish interspaces; the
cheeks and snout are purplish, with round brassy
spots; the fins are pale, blotched with orange;
the iris of the eye is golden.</p>

<p>The saucer-eye grows to twelve or fifteen
inches in length, and is considered a good pan-fish
at Key West, commanding a ready sale. It is
found in the same situations as the other porgies,
grunts, and snappers, and is equally voracious,
taking the proffered bait eagerly. The tackle for
this porgy is the same as for the others, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of a light rod, multiplying reel, braided linen line,
size F or G, three-foot leader, Sproat-bend hooks.
No. 1 or 2, on gut snells, with sinker in accordance
with the depth of the water and the strength
of the tide. Almost any bait will answer, as sea-crawfish,
cut conch, or fish.</p>


<h3>THE LITTLE-HEAD PORGY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Calamus proridens</i>)</h4>

<p>This species was first described by Jordan and
Gilbert, in 1883, from Key West. They named
it <i>proridens</i>, meaning "prow tooth," owing to its
projecting canines. It is abundant in the West
Indies, and is quite common about Key West and
the neighboring keys. It is one of the smallest
and prettiest of the porgies, and is called little-head
in contradistinction to the jolt-head or big-head
porgy. It is almost identical in shape to
the saucer-eye porgy, both in head and body.</p>

<p>It is brighter in color than the other porgies,
being quite silvery with iridescent reflections; the
scales of the upper part of the body have violet
spots, forming longitudinal streaks; those on the
lower part have pale orange spots; the sides
have several dark bands; the snout and cheeks
have horizontal, wavy stripes of violet-blue; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
dorsal fin is violet, with orange border; the anal
fin is blue; the caudal fin has an orange band. It
is of similar habits to the other porgies, and found
with them, but is less common. It is a good pan-fish,
growing only to six or eight inches in length.</p>

<p>The little-head porgy, though small in size, is
equally as voracious as the other porgies, and is
well worth catching if only to admire its beauty.
The same tackle will answer as for the others,
or more especially that mentioned for the saucer-eye,
and the same baits can be employed.</p>

<p>My Bahama negro boatman, alluded to under
the jolt-head, continued his dissertation on the
porgies somewhat in this wise: "Now, sir, the
little-'ed porgy is a cute little chap; 'e gits to
vind'ard o' the big-'ed, hevry time. 'E doesn't
butt 'is 'ed aginst the rocks, a-knockin' the shells,
but 'e 'as two long teeth like gouge-chisels, and
'e jist scoops hoff the crawlin' things from the
rock-patches as 'andsome as you like. Little-'ed
little wit; big-'ed not a bit!"</p>


<h3>THE GRASS PORGY</h3>

<h4>(<i>Calamus arctifrons</i>)</h4>

<p>This pretty porgy was first described by Goode
and Bean, in 1882, from Pensacola, Florida. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
named it <i>arctifrons</i>, meaning "contracted forehead,"
owing to the narrow forehead. It has a
more extended range in the Gulf of Mexico than
the other porgies, being common in grassy situations
from Pensacola to Key West; it is not
known from the West Indies.</p>

<p>The general outline of the grass porgy is very
similar to that of the saucer-eye and little-head
porgies, though the back is not quite so elevated;
the profile is unevenly curved, being quite convex
in front of the eye. The mouth is slightly larger
than in the saucer-eye. Its color is olivaceous,
with dark spots, and several dark vertical bars
across the body; many of the scales have pearly
spots; there are several yellow spots along the
lateral line; the cheeks are brownish, with yellow
shades; the upper fins are barred or spotted;
the lower fins are paler.</p>

<p>It is the smallest of the porgies, but one of
the prettiest. It grows to six or eight inches in
length. It is mentioned incidentally with the
others of its family in order that it may be known
to anglers who are so fortunate as to catch it
and admire it. The same tackle and bait
employed for the others are suitable. It is found
usually in grassy situations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS FISHES</h3>


<h3>THE LADY-FISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Albula vulpes</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Albula vulpes.</i> The Lady-fish. Body rather elongate, little compressed,
covered with rather small, brilliantly-silvery scales;
head naked; snout conic, subquadrangular, shaped like the
snout of a pig, and overlapping the small, inferior, horizontal
mouth; head 3-3/4; depth 4; scales 9-71-7; D. 15; A. 8; maxillary
rather strong, short, with a distinct supplemental bone,
slipping under the membraneous edge of the very broad preorbital;
premaxillaries short, not protractile; lateral margin of
upper jaw formed by the maxillaries; both jaws, vomer and
palatines, with bands of villiform teeth; broad patches of coarse,
blunt, paved teeth on the tongue behind and on the sphenoid
and pterygoid bones; opercle moderate, firm; preopercle with
a broad, flat, membraneous edge, which extends backward over
the base of the opercle; gill membranes separate; no gular
plate; a fold of skin across gill membranes, its free edge crenate;
belly flattish, covered with ordinary scales, not carinate; eye
large, with a bony ridge above it, and almost covered with an
annular adipose eyelid.</p></blockquote>

<p>The lady-fish, or bonefish, is the only representative
of the family <i>Albulidæ</i>. It has long
been known to science through the early voyagers
to the southern coasts of America. It was first
described by Marcgrave in his "History of Brazil,"
in 1648, and afterward by Catesby, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
"History of the Carolinas," in 1737, and named
<i>vulpes</i>, or "fox," by Linnæus, in 1758, from a
specimen taken at the Bahamas.</p>

<p>It inhabits the sandy shores of all warm seas
and is, perhaps, the most cosmopolitan of all
game-fishes, being known from Asia, Arabia.
North and South America, the Pacific Islands,
etc. It is common on the coasts of the Atlantic
and Pacific in the United States, and is especially
abundant in Florida waters, occasionally straying
in summer as far north as Long Island.</p>

<p>The lady-fish is allied to the herring tribe. It
has a long, gracefully-shaped body, nearly round,
or but little compressed; its depth is a fourth of
its length; it has a long head with a projecting,
piglike snout, overlapping the small mouth, which
is well armed with teeth; both jaws and the roof
of the mouth in front have bands of brushlike
teeth, with patches of coarse, blunt, paved teeth
on the back of the mouth and tongue. Its color
is bluish green above, with metallic reflections;
the sides are very bright and silvery, with faint
streaks along the rows of scales; the belly is
white, and it feeds on small fishes and crustaceans.</p>

<p>Its spawning habits are not well understood,
though the young pass through a metamorphosis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
being band-shaped, with very small head and
loose, transparent tissues. I have found them
abundant on the Gulf coast of Florida. The
lady-fish grows to a length of from one to three
feet, and to a weight of from one to twelve pounds,
though it is usually taken from two to five
pounds. It is a good food-fish, highly esteemed
at Key West and in the Bermudas by those who
know it best.</p>

<p>For its size it is one of the gamest fishes of
the seacoast. When hooked it fights as much
in the air as in the water, continually leaping
above the surface like an animated silver shuttle,
to which I likened it more than twenty years ago.
It is now becoming better known to anglers who
visit Florida in the winter season, who recognize
in it much more enjoyable sport on light tackle
than they can obtain with the heavy tools required
for the tarpon and jewfish.</p>

<p>A black-bass rod, or the Little Giant rod of
eight ounces, is light enough, as a heavier fish
than the lady-fish is apt to be hooked. A good
multiplying reel and fifty yards of braided linen
line, size F, and Sproat hooks, No. 1 or 2, on
gut snells, will be found eminently suitable. No
sinker is needed, as the fishing is done on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
surface, though a small brass box-swivel may be
used to connect the snell and line, as in black-bass
fishing. A leader is not necessary, but it
may be used if thought best.</p>

<p>The bait may be a beach-flea, or a very small,
silvery fish, as a sardine, pilchard, or mullet,
though a small shell squid, or a trolling-spoon
of the size of a nickel, with a single hook, may
be employed in lieu of live bait, and is quite
successful if kept in constant motion. The minnow
is to be hooked through the lips and cast
as in black-bass fishing, reeling it in slowly on
or near the surface.</p>

<p>The fishing may be done from any convenient
place near a pass or inlet on the flood tide. A
sand-spit at the entrance, or a boat anchored just
within the inlet, are desirable places, though good
fishing is sometimes available from the end of
a pier in a tideway. Fine fishing may also be
had at other stages of the tide about offshore
reefs and shoals. I have taken the lady-fish, with
both fly and bait, in Biscayne Bay, in Cards and
Barnes sounds, along the keys to Key West, and
at nearly every inlet on the Gulf coast, as far
north as Pass-a-Grille, above Tampa Bay, and
usually found it associated with the ten-pounder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady-fish, when hooked, will probably astonish
the angler who is attached to one for the
first time, by its aërial gyrations and quick movements.
But the rod must be held at an angle
of forty-five degrees, so as to maintain a taut line,
notwithstanding its constant leaping; for if any
slack line is given, it is almost sure to shake out
the hook. And as the leaps are made in such
quick succession, the only safe plan is to keep
the rod bent, either in giving or taking line, or
when holding the fish on the strain of the rod.</p>

<p>The lady-fish will often take a gaudy black-bass
fly, in which event a black-bass fly-rod or a
heavy trout fly-rod will come handy, with corresponding
tackle. A heavy braided linen line, size
D, is better suited for salt water than the enamelled
silk line, and will cast a fly nearly as well.
The flies advised for the Spanish mackerel will
answer as well for the lady-fish, though I have
found the silver-doctor and coachman both very
taking toward dusk, which is the most favorable
time for fly-fishing, though the first half of the
flood tide and the last half of the ebb are usually
both favorable times about the inlets.</p>

<p>Twenty years or more ago I called the attention
of northern anglers to the lady-fish, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
bone-fish, and the ten-pounder, or bony-fish, as
game-fishes of high degree, and accorded equal
praise to both species as to gameness. I have
never been able to convince myself as to which
is entitled to the palm; but they are both good
enough, and comparisons are indeed odious as
between them. I am glad to note that they are
coming to the front and their merits at last recognized.
Of late years northern anglers are
having great sport with the lady-fish on Biscayne
Bay; but judging from their communications in
the sportsman's journals, they are confusing the
lady-fish with the ten-pounder. This is easily
accounted for, inasmuch as they are usually of
about the same size, and have very much the
same general appearance in form and bright
silvery coloration; and moreover there is a confusion
attending their vernacular names, as the
lady-fish is sometimes known as bony-fish. It
should be remembered that the lady-fish has an
overhanging, piglike snout and larger scales,
while the ten-pounder has a terminal mouth with
the jaws about equal, and smaller scales. Moreover,
the bony-fish, or ten-pounder, has a bony
plate under the lower jaw, like the tarpon, which
is absent in the lady-fish. Both are cosmopolitan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
inhabiting the warm seas of both continents.
They have been known to science for a century
and a half, and have been described by many
naturalists from different parts of the world. The
current specific names were both bestowed by
Linnæus. Catesby, in 1837, called the lady-fish
(<i>Albula vulpes</i>) of the Bahamas "bone-fish," while
Captain William Dampier, one of the early explorers,
called the bony-fish (<i>Elops saurus</i>) of the
Bahamas "ten-pounder." The fishermen of Key
West usually know the lady-fish as bone-fish, and
the ten-pounder as bony-fish. The best plan for
anglers is to adopt the names lady-fish and ten-pounder
for them, and relegate or ignore the
names bone-fish, bony-fish, and skip-jack.</p>


<h3>THE TEN-POUNDER</h3>

<h4>(<i>Elops saurus</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Elops saurus.</i> The Ten-pounder. Body elongate, covered with
small, silvery scales; head 4-1/4; depth 6; eye 4, large; scales
12-120-13; D. 20; A. 13; dorsal fin slightly behind ventrals,
its last rays short, depressible into a sheath of scales; anal fin
smaller, similarly depressible; pectoral and ventral fins moderate,
each with a long, accessory scale; opercular bones thin, with
expanded membraneous borders; a scaly occipital collar; gular
plate 3 to 4 times as long as broad; pseudobranchiæ large;
lateral line straight, its tubes simple.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ten-pounder, or bony-fish, belongs to the
same family, <i>Elopidæ</i>, as the tarpon, and both are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
allied to the herring tribe. The ten-pounder was
first described by Linnæus, in 1776, from specimens
sent to him from South Carolina by Dr.
Garden. He named it <i>saurus</i>, or "lizard," but
there is nothing lizard-like about the ten-pounder.
I imagine that Dr. Garden sent the fish under
the name of "lizard," from hearing it called by its
Spanish name of "lisa," which is pronounced
much like lizard. The ten-pounder was mentioned
by some of the old voyagers to the West
Indies and Carolinas. Like the lady-fish, the ten-pounder
is a cosmopolitan, existing in the warm
seas of both hemispheres. In the United States
it is common to the southern portions of the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts and the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<p>In the general aspect and contour of its silvery
body the ten-pounder has much the appearance
of the lady-fish, and has been often confounded
with it by anglers. Its body, however, is more
slender than that of the lady-fish, with smaller
scales and a very different head and mouth; the
lady-fish has a piglike, overhanging snout, while
the lower jaw of the ten-pounder projects slightly.
The depth of the body of the ten-pounder is only
about a sixth of its length, and the body is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
much compressed, being nearly round. The head
is long and pointed, with a very wide mouth, with
upper and lower lips nearly equal, or terminal.
The eye is large, hence one of its names, big-eyed
herring. There are many series of small
and sharp cardlike teeth on the jaws, tongue, and
roof of the mouth. There is a bony plate beneath
the lower jaw.</p>

<p>The color on the back is greenish or bluish,
the sides silvery and bright, and belly white; the
top of the head is greenish, with bronze reflections;
the cheeks have a golden lustre; the lower
fins are tinged with yellow, the others dusky.</p>

<p>Its habits are not unlike those of the lady-fish,
and they often associate. It feeds principally on
crustaceans and also on small fishes. It frequents
sandy shoals and banks in shallow water at high
tide, also grassy situations where its food abounds.
Its breeding habits are not well understood,
though, like the lady-fish, its young pass through
a larval form, and are ribbon-shaped. It grows to
a length of two feet or more, and weighs several
pounds, sometimes ten or more. It is quite bony,
and is not considered a good food-fish, but excels
as a game-fish, being equal to the lady-fish in this
respect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>The same tackle as that recommended for its
congener, the lady-fish, answers just as well for the
ten-pounder, and it can be fished for in the same
locations. It frequents shallow water on the
grassy banks and sandy shoals rather more than
the lady-fish, and can be sought there accordingly,
as well as at the inlets when the tide is making.</p>

<p>Both the ten-pounder and the lady-fish are
warm-water fishes. They are to be found in
Biscayne Bay and along the neighboring keys
during winter, and as the water becomes warmer
they extend their range northward on both coasts.
After the disastrous frosts that occurred during
the winters of 1886 and 1895 in Florida, I saw
windrows of dead ten-pounders, lady-fishes, and
tarpon on the beaches about Charlotte Harbor.
They had become chilled from the sudden lowering
of the temperature. I have caught both the
ten-pounder and lady-fish as far north as Tampa
Bay on the west coast of Florida, and Indian River
Inlet on the east coast. My fishing was mostly
done from the points of inlets and passes, on the
flood tide, and usually with the artificial fly, in
shallow water, the time and places mentioned being
the most favorable for fly-fishing. At other
times I have fished on the shallow bars and grassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
banks, using such crustaceans as fiddlers, beach-fleas,
and shrimps for bait, alternated with small
minnows. When beach-fleas are used a fly-rod is
preferable and the hook should be smaller than
where other bait is employed; No. 4 is about right,
if of the Sproat or O'Shaughnessy pattern, they being
of larger and stronger wire than other patterns.
If beach-fleas are used with a bait-rod, a small
sinker must be added to give weight to the cast.</p>

<p>The ten-pounder snaps at the bait or fly in the
manner of most fishes, and is off immediately in
a wild whirl, skimming through the water, if
shallow, in a way to astonish the angler who
hooks one for the first time. Then follows a
series of brilliant leaps and aërial contortions that
commands the admiration of the coldest-blooded
fisher. The lady-fish, however, owing to the
position of its mouth, being underneath its projecting
snout, does not at first take the bait with
the vim and snap of the ten-pounder, but apparently
nibbles or mouths it for a while, but when
hooked displays the same energy and desperate
efforts to escape as its congener. The consistent
angler may truly exclaim with Pope:&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE SNOOK, OR ROVALLIA</h3>

<h4>(<i>Centropomus undecimalis</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Centropomus undecimalis.</i> The Snook. Body elongate, with elevated
back and straight abdomen; head 3; depth 4; eye 7;
scales 9-75-16; D. VIII-I, 10; A. III, 6; head depressed,
pikelike, the lower jaw projecting; villiform teeth in bands on
jaws, vomer, and palatines; tongue smooth; dorsal fins well
separated; preorbital faintly serrated; subopercular flap extending
nearly to dorsal fin; maxillary to middle of eye; gill-rakers
4 + 9.</p></blockquote>

<p>The snook belongs to the family <i>Centropomidæ</i>,
which embraces a dozen or more species, most of
which inhabit the West Indies and the southern
Pacific coast, and are all good game-fishes. The
snook was first described by Bloch from Jamaica,
in 1792; he named it <i>undecimalis</i>, or "eleven,"
as the soft dorsal fin has eleven rays. The name
snook was mentioned as the name of this fish by
the early explorers, among whom was Captain
William Dampier, who also mentioned several
others, as "ten-pounders," "cavallies," "tarpoms,"
etc. Snook is derived from "snoek," the Dutch
name for the pike, which it resembles slightly in
the shape of the head, though it is more like the
pike-perch in its structure and appearance. On
the east coast of Florida this fish is known as the
snook, and on the Gulf coast as rovallia, the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
name being a corruption of its Spanish name
<i>robalo</i>, by which it is known in Havana. It is
sometimes called sergeant-fish, from the black
stripe along its sides. It is common along the
shores of the Gulf of Mexico, from Texas to
the West Indies, and is especially abundant in
the bays and lagoons of both coasts of Florida,
often ascending the rivers to fresh water.</p>

<p>It has a long, robust, and nearly round body, its
depth being a fourth of its length; the back is
slightly elevated and arched. The head is long
and depressed, or flat, and is more than a third of
the total length of the body; the mouth is large,
with a projecting lower jaw; the gill-cover is very
long; there are brushlike teeth on the jaws and
the roof of the mouth, but no sharp or conical
teeth as in the pike or pike-perch.</p>

<p>The color of the back is olive-green, the sides
silvery, and the belly white; there is a distinct
and very black stripe along the side, following
the lateral line from the head to the caudal fin;
the dorsal fins are dusky; the lower fins are
yellowish.</p>

<p>The snook is a very voracious fish, feeding on
fishes, crabs, and other crustaceans, and resorts
to sandy shoals and grassy flats where its food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
is found. It grows to a length of two or three
feet, and a weight of twenty or thirty pounds. It
is a fair food-fish, though not held in much favor
in Florida where so many better food-fishes are
common. It is better flavored if skinned instead
of scaled.</p>

<p>It is a strong, active game-fish, that, when
hooked, starts off with a rush that is dangerous
to light tackle, and its subsequent man&oelig;uvres
require very careful handling when it is of a
large size. It has smashed many light rods in
the hands of anglers who were not aware of its
pugnacity. It will take any kind of natural bait,
and rises well to the artificial fly.</p>

<p>A rather heavy black-bass rod or a light
striped-bass rod is required for the large fish of
the bays and estuaries, though ordinary black-bass
tackle will answer for those of less weight
at the mouths of streams, or in fresh water, to
which it often resorts. A good multiplying reel
and fifty yards of braided linen line are sufficient,
though one hundred yards will not be amiss, as
large fishes of other species are very apt to be
hooked in Florida waters. Sproat or O'Shaughnessy
hooks, Nos. 1-0 to 3-0, on heavy gut
snells are required, with a brass box-swivel to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
connect the snell with the reel line; a sinker
may be used or not, depending on the strength
of the tide, though the fishing is usually practised
in quiet water, and not in the tideways.</p>

<p>A small fish, mullet or sardine, or fiddler-crab
bait, will prove very enticing to the snook,
though the minnow is better adapted for casting.
The fishing is much like black-bass fishing in
fresh waters, and the snook takes the bait in its
mouth in much the same way as a bass, starting
off at once with a great commotion if near the
surface. Its desperate and vigorous spurts and
rushes are apt to put one's tackle in jeopardy if
the fish is large, and it must be handled with
caution and skill.</p>

<p>For fly-fishing, a rod of nine or ten ounces is
not too heavy where the fish run large. A heavy
braided linen line, size D or E, is best for casting
the fly in salt water. Black-bass flies of showy
patterns, on hooks No. 1 or 2, as coachman,
silver-doctor, polka, oriole, red ibis, professor, etc.,
will answer. The most favorable time is on the
flood tide near the inlets, or toward evening if
in quiet coves or lagoons. The fly should be
repeatedly cast and then allowed to sink a foot or
two. If fishing from a boat, it must be kept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
the deeper water, and the casts made under the
mangroves, or to the edges of sand-spits, shoals, or
mud-flats, which abound in all bays on the west
coast of Florida.</p>

<p>The snook is easily captured by trolling with
hand-line and the spoon or minnow, though it is
a questionable style of sport at best. Along the
edges of shoals and mud-flats and over grassy
banks the snook will be found at home. A
landing-net should always be used for any kind
of fishing with the fly.</p>


<h3>THE TRIPLE-TAIL</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lobotes surinamensis</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Lobotes surinamensis.</i> The Triple-tail. Body oblong, deep, compressed
and elevated; head 3; depth 2; scales 47; head small;
snout short; mouth moderate, oblique, with thick lips; profile
of head concave; upper jaw very protractile; the lower, the
longest; maxillary without supplemental bone; jaws with narrow
bands of villiform teeth, in front of which is a row of larger
conical teeth, directed backward; no teeth on vomer or palatines;
preopercle strongly serrate; maxillary reaching middle
of orbit; scales around eyes small, those on opercles large; eye
small; small scales running up on the base of soft dorsal, anal,
and caudal fins; caudal rounded; D. XII, 15; A. III, 11; soft
rays of dorsal and anal fins elevated, of nearly equal size, and
opposite each other; anal spines graduated; branchial rays 6.</p></blockquote>

<p>The triple-tail belongs to the family <i>Lobotidæ</i>.
It is allied to the snapper family, but differs in
having no teeth on the roof of the mouth. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
first described by Bloch, in 1790, from Surinam.
South America. He named it <i>surinamensis</i>,
from the name of the locality whence his specimens
were procured. There is another species
on the Pacific coast, <i>Lobotes pacificus</i>, that is
quite abundant at Panama, where it is known as
berrugate.</p>

<p>The triple-tail is known in all warm seas. Its
range on the Atlantic coast extends from South
America north to Cape Cod, though it is not
abundant. I have taken it on both the east and
west coasts of Florida. At Tampa it is called
black snapper, and in South Carolina it is known
as black perch. I have never heard it called
flasher, which is said to be its name in the
markets of New York.</p>

<p>It is a short, thick, robust fish, nearly half as
deep as long, with an elevated back, and with the
ventral outline corresponding with its dorsal
curve. The head is a third of the length of the
body, its profile concave, the snout prominent,
and the lower jaw projecting; the mouth is of
moderate size, with thick lips.</p>

<p>The color of the back is dark, or greenish black,
the sides silvery gray, sometimes blotched and
tinged with yellow; the fins are dusky gray or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
yellowish. In life these colors are very bright,
but after death they become almost black.</p>

<p>It feeds on small fishes, mussels, and crustaceans
and grows to a length of two or three feet, weighing
from ten to fifteen pounds, though its usual
size is not more than one-half of this length and
weight. Its breeding habits are unknown. It is
found in northern waters only during the summer
months, but from South Carolina to Florida it is
common all the year.</p>

<p>It is a strong and vigorous fish, but rather
slow and sluggish in its movements, and not
remarkable for game qualities, though it pulls
steadily and strongly when hooked. It will take
shrimp, clam, fiddler, or small fishes as bait.</p>

<p>A light striped-bass chum rod is very suitable
for the triple-tail when of good size. A multiplying
reel and fifty yards of braided linen line, hooks
No. 1-0 or 2-0, on heavy gut snells, and a brass
box-swivel, make up the rest of the tackle. A
sinker will probably not be needed as it is usually
found in quiet coves about sandy shoals or grassy
flats. I have taken it on both coasts of Florida,
though it is more common on the east coast. I
have also caught it in Chesapeake Bay and near
Charleston, South Carolina, but never over five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
pounds in weight, though I have seen it taken in
nets up to about ten pounds. Its short and
rounded caudal fin, with the soft portions of the
dorsal and anal fins, together, give the appearance
of three tails, hence the name triple-tail, by which
it is generally known.</p>


<h3>THE COBIA</h3>

<h4>(<i>Rachycentron canadus</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rachycentron canadus.</i> The Cobia. Body elongate, fusiform, sub cylindrical,
covered with very small, smooth, adherent scales;
head 4-1/4; depth 5-2/3; D. VIII-I, 26; A. II, 25; head broad, low,
pikelike, the bones above appearing through the thin skin;
mouth wide, nearly horizontal, the maxillary reaching front of
eye; both jaws, vomer, palatines, and tongue with bands of
short, sharp teeth; lower jaw longest; premaxillaries not protractile;
preopercle unarmed; two dorsal fins, the spines of the
first depressible in a groove; soft dorsal long and low, somewhat
falcate, similar to, and nearly opposite, the anal; caudal
fin strongly forked; no caudal keel; no finlets; gill-rakers short
and stout; pectorals broad and falcate.</p></blockquote>

<p>The cobia, or sergeant-fish, is the only fish of its
family, <i>Rachycentridæ</i>. It was first described by
Linnæus, in 1766, from a specimen sent to him by
Dr. Garden from South Carolina; it is allied to the
mackerel tribe, and is found in all warm seas in
the old and new worlds. On the Atlantic coast
it is common from the Chesapeake Bay to Florida,
but occasionally strays north to Cape Cod in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
summer. It is rather rare on the west coast of
Florida, but common on the east coast.</p>

<p>It is a long and round-bodied fish, quite gracefully
formed, with a depth of about one-fifth of its
length. The head is broad and flat, something
like that of the pike, with a wide mouth, and with
jaws, roof of mouth, and tongue armed with bands
of short, sharp teeth; the lower jaw projects.
The back is olive-brown, or dusky, the sides
lighter and silvery, and the belly white; a distinct
broad and very dark stripe extends from the upper
jaw and through the eye to the caudal fin,
with an indistinct one above and below, and parallel
with it. Owing to this dark stripe the cobia
is sometimes called sergeant-fish, thus confounding
it with the snook.</p>

<p>The habits of the cobia are not unlike those of
the pike, or mascalonge, of fresh waters, in that it
is solitary and lies in wait for its prey, and is
almost as rapacious. It lies under the mangroves
and cocoa-plum bushes along Indian River and
other streams of the east coast of Florida, watching
for stray fishes and crabs on which it feeds.
It is commonly seen of a length of two or three
feet, but grows considerably longer, with a weight
of fifteen to twenty pounds. The largest I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
seen was at Key West; it was fully five feet long.
It is not uncommon in the Chesapeake Bay, and
like most of the mackerel tribe it is a fairly good
food-fish. It spawns in summer, but its breeding
habits are not fully understood.</p>

<p>As might be imagined from its shape and habits,
it is a good game-fish, and quite strong and vigorous
on the rod. It requires all of the angler's
skill to land it safely, especially when it is taken
about the mangroves, among whose arching and
numerous roots it is sure to take refuge if it can
do so. It will take a small fish bait or a crab,
going for it with a pikelike rush. I once took
one on Indian River with a large red ibis fly, but
never succeeded in catching another with the
same lure.</p>

<p>A strong, rather heavy rod is necessary for the
cobia, which the Key West fishermen call cobi-ó.
A striped-bass chum rod of natural bamboo is a
good and serviceable tool for the work, with multiplying
reel and braided linen line, to which is
affixed a Sproat hook, No. 3-0, on gimp snell, by
a brass box-swivel. A sinker should not be used
about the mangroves.</p>

<p>A fiddler-crab, a mullet, or other small fish is
hooked through the lips, and is cast from a boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
to the edge of the mangroves or other bushes,
in the same way as in casting for mascalonge
in northern waters. I have never tried casting
with a spoon, which might be successful, but a
minnow is better by far. The cobia takes the
bait with a fierce lunge, and turning quickly
endeavors to return to his lair, a proceeding that
must be thwarted by the angler at all hazards
to his rod or tackle, for once under the arching
roots of the mangroves he is as good as gone.
The boat must be rowed to open water at once,
while a strong strain is maintained by the rod on
the fish. With open water the angler can play
his fish with leisure, though he will be severely
taxed by the struggles of as game a fish as he
is likely to meet during a winter's sojourn in
Florida.</p>


<h3>THE SPOTTED WEAKFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Cynoscion nebulosus</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Cynoscion nebulosus.</i> The Spotted Weakfish. Body rather elongate,
compressed; head 3-1/2; depth 4-1/2; scales 10-70-11; D. X-I, 26;
A. II, 10; eye 7; snout long and acute; mouth large, maxillary
reaching to posterior edge of eye; lower pharyngeals narrow,
each with 7 or 8 series of short teeth, the inner enlarged; maxillary,
preorbital, and lower jaw naked; canines in upper jaw
strong; lower jaw without canines, other teeth in narrow bands,
sharp, but closely set; membrane of preopercle serrate, the bone
entire; pseudobranchiæ well developed; caudal lunate; soft
rays of dorsal and anal scaleless; gill-rakers short and thick,
4 + 7.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>This fish is closely allied to the northern weakfish,
and belongs to the same family, <i>Sciænidæ</i>.
It is known very generally in Florida as trout,
salt-water trout, or sea-trout, owing to its spots.
It is, of course, not a trout at all, and these
names should be set aside; moreover, the name
sea-trout is preoccupied by the sea-run brook-trout
of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Its present specific
name, <i>nebulosus</i>, or "clouded," was bestowed by
Cuvier and Valenciennes, in 1830, displacing the
earlier and better name <i>maculatus</i>, or "spotted,"
conferred by Dr. S. L. Mitchill, in 1815, for reasons
that it is unnecessary to refer to here. It
is abundant from Virginia to Florida, and along
the Gulf coast to Texas. It occasionally strays
as far north as New Jersey.</p>

<p>It is almost the counterpart of the common
weakfish in the form of its body, the depth of
which is about a fourth of its length, and with a
similar head, eye, and mouth, but with somewhat
smaller scales, and a few less rays in the second
dorsal fin. Its mouth is large, with narrow bands
of sharp teeth on the jaws, and two long canine
teeth in the upper jaw.</p>

<p>Its color is bluish gray on the back, with steely
reflections, the sides are silvery and the belly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
white. The upper half of the body has numerous
black spots, as large as the pupil of the eye, with
smaller ones on the soft dorsal and anal fins; the
other fins are plainer, and the anal fin is dusky.</p>

<p>The spotted weakfish is a better food-fish, and
also a better game-fish, than its northern cousin.
It is abundant in the bays of Florida during the
entire year, often ascending the streams to fresh
water. Its usual weight is from two to four
pounds, often of six to eight, and sometimes of
even ten pounds or more. It appears in schools
in March and April, often in company with the
Spanish mackerel, and runs into brackish water
for the purpose of spawning. It spawns in the
spring; the eggs are buoyant, quite small, about
thirty to the inch, and hatch in two days. It
feeds on small fishes and crustaceans.</p>

<p>All things considered, it is one of the best
game-fishes of Florida. It is a surface feeder
and takes the artificial fly eagerly, as well as
natural bait, or the artificial squid and trolling-spoon.
With light tackle it affords good sport,
being a strong and determined fighter. It is a
great favorite with all anglers who are acquainted
with its merits.</p>

<p>When of the usual weight of from two to four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
pounds, black-bass tackle is very suitable and
serviceable in rod, reel, line, hooks, or flies, though
a rather heavy braided linen line is better adapted
for salt water than a silk one. To be more explicit,
an eight-ounce rod, multiplying reel, line
size F, Sproat hooks Nos. 2-0 to 3-0 on gut or
gimp snells, will be found to be just about right
for bait-fishing.</p>

<p>For fly-fishing, a rod of eight ounces, click reel,
braided linen line, size E, leader of three or four
feet, single gut, and black-bass flies such as silver-doctor,
red ibis, Abbey, soldier, oriole, coachman,
etc., on hooks Nos. 1 to 2, will be found to answer
in skilful hands. A heavier rod may be used
when the fish run larger, and also flies on hooks
a size or two larger. Very small phantom minnows,
spoons, or squids may be often used with
success when the fish are running in schools in
the spring.</p>

<p>Fishing, either with fly or bait, can be practised
with good results at flood tide from the end of
long piers that extend to deep water, or at the
points of inlets during the running season. The
piers at Port Tampa and St. Petersburg, on
Tampa Bay, also at Mullet Key and Egmont
Key, or Pass-a-Grille, in the same vicinity, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
famed fishing resorts in March and April. I prefer
to fish from a boat moored to the pier, rather
than from the pier itself, as the fish are not so
likely to see one, and they are more conveniently
landed.</p>

<p>During the winter the best fishing will be found
in the bays and bayous, or in the streams, in the
vicinity of sand-shoals or mud-flats, at almost any
stage of the tide, which usually rises but a foot or
two in the bays of the west coast. At the inlets
and passes, at the first of the flood and last of the
ebb tide, the fishing is also good during the winter
months.</p>

<p>The spotted weakfish takes its prey at the surface
with a snap of its jaws that is quite audible,
especially at night when one's yacht is at anchor.
It takes the angler's fly or bait in the same way.
It will remind him forcibly of the bite of a large
brook-trout, and its manner of resistance when
hooked is very much the same as with that fish&mdash;one
reason for the name sea-trout.</p>

<p>The fishing is especially good in Tampa and
Sarasota bays, and the upper portion of Charlotte
Harbor, on the west coast; and on the east coast
at the mouths of streams entering Halifax River.
Mosquito Lagoon, or Indian River.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE DEEP-SEA WEAKFISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Cynoscion thalassinus</i>)</h4>

<p>This species was first described by Dr. Holbrook,
in 1859, from the coast of South Carolina.
He named it <i>thalassinus</i>, or "pertaining to the
sea," from its supposed habit of living in deep
water. It is either a rare fish or it has been
confounded with the common weakfish. It has
been recorded from several places on the South
Atlantic and Gulf coasts, in Virginia, South
Carolina, Florida, and Mississippi. It is supposed
to inhabit the deep water of the sea and Gulf,
though this is by no means certain.</p>

<p>Its form is very similar to the spotted weakfish,
with a more pointed snout and somewhat larger
eye; otherwise it is much the same. Its color is
brownish above, lighter below; the middle of the
sides is marked with many dark dots; there is a
dark blotch on the upper part of the cheek; the
first dorsal fin is black, the second dorsal and
anal fins are dusky, and the other fins pale. The
same remarks as to fishing for the spotted weakfish
will apply as well to this species, if the
opportunity should occur to the angler. It is a
doubtful species at best, and may eventually prove
to be an aberrant form of the spotted weakfish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE BERMUDA CHUB</h3>

<h4>(<i>Kyphosus sectatrix</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Kyphosus sectatrix.</i> The Bermuda Chub. Body ovate, somewhat
compressed; head 3-3/4; depth 2-1/8; scales 10-55-16; D. XI, 12;
A. III, 11; head short, with blunt snout; mouth small, maxillary
reaching front of eye; each jaw with a series of narrow
incisors, implanted with compressed conspicuous roots posteriorly;
behind these a narrow band of villiform teeth; fine teeth
on vomer, palatines, and tongue; teeth 35 to 40 on each side;
preopercle weakly serrate; top and sides of head finely scaled;
interorbital region gibbous, below which point snout is truncate;
soft dorsal and anal very low; second anal spine highest; caudal
well forked, the lower lobe longest; gill-rakers long; dorsal
spines depressible in a groove of scales; small ctenoid scales
entirely covering the soft portions of the vertical fins, and extending
up on the paired fins.</p></blockquote>

<p>The chub belongs to the family of rudder-fishes,
<i>Kyphosidæ</i>. It was noticed as <i>sectatrix</i>
by Catesby in his "History of the Carolinas," in
1738, and was so named by Linnæus in 1758.
<i>Sectatrix</i> is the feminine of <i>sectator</i>, meaning
"one who follows," in allusion to its habit of
following vessels. Its range is along the South
Atlantic coast to the West Indies, sometimes
straying as far north as Cape Cod in the summer.
It is common on the west coast of Florida.</p>

<p>It has an oblong, elliptical body, its depth
being more than a third of its length. The head
is short, with a blunt snout and small mouth,
and a curved profile. There are well-developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
incisor teeth in each jaw, with peculiar horizontal
bases. Its color is bluish-gray, with steely lustre;
the sides have numerous narrow, indistinct, yellowish
or brassy stripes, alternating with bluish
ones; there is a pale stripe below the eye, and
a yellowish one above and below it; the fins are
dull grayish.</p>

<p>The chub feeds on barnacles and other small
mollusks, and is found wherever they abound,
sometimes in rather deep water. Its usual size
is six to ten inches, weighing from one to three
or four pounds, but it occasionally grows to fifteen
or eighteen inches in length in favorable locations.
Its spawning habits have not been
studied. It is an excellent pan-fish. Light
tackle is needed for the chub and pin-fish, both
being usually found together. The hook should
be small but strong, with gimp snell; Sproat
hooks, No. 1 or 2, are very suitable. The best
bait is fiddler-crab or hermit-crab. It is quite
a game little fish.</p>

<p>I was once staying for a few days' fishing at
the Quarantine Station on Mullet Key, in Tampa
Bay. The station is built on piles in water
twenty feet deep. There was a trap-door in the
floor of one of the rooms, through which many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
kinds of fish could be seen swimming about in the
very clear water. These fishes could be readily
taken with the hook or the spear, as they were
unable to see any one in the dark room above.
I was much interested watching the chub and
sheepshead pinching off the barnacles from the
piles with their chisel-like teeth. A dozen could
be easily taken in as many minutes with fiddler
bait, and the table was kept well supplied with
chub, which was the favorite food-fish during my
sojourn.</p>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/illo_446.jpg">THE TURBOT</a></p>
</div>


<h3>THE ANGEL-FISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Chætodipterus faber</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Chætodipterus faber.</i> The Angel-fish. Body much elevated and
compressed, its outline nearly orbicular, the anterior profile
nearly vertical; head 3; depth 1 to 1-1/2; scales 60; D. VIII-I,
20; A. III, 18; jaws about equal; no teeth on vomer or palatines;
teeth on jaws slender, somewhat movable; preopercle
finely serrate; two dorsal fins, somewhat connected; vertical
fins falcate in the adult; first soft ray of dorsal filamentous;
ventral fin with a large accessory scale.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are a number of angel-fishes in Florida,
remarkable for their bizarre and beautiful coloration,
but of no importance to the angler as
they do not often take the baited hook, their
very small mouths and weak teeth being only
adapted for feeding on the minute organisms
about the coral reefs. The common angel-fish,
or spade-fish, is more sombre in hue than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
others, and belongs to a different family, <i>Ephippidæ</i>;
it has a somewhat larger mouth, and is
more widely distributed. It was described by
Broussonet, in 1782, from Jamaica, who named
it <i>faber</i>, or "blacksmith," though why is difficult
to imagine, except that it is dark in its general
hue, with smutty cross bars. It is very abundant
from the South Atlantic coast to South America,
and is not uncommon, occasionally, as far north
as Cape Cod. It is very common on the east
and west coasts of Florida.</p>

<p>It has a short, very deep body, nearly round in
outline, and very much compressed; it is almost
as deep as long. Its head is short and deep,
with its profile nearly vertical. The mouth is
small, with slender, movable teeth, on jaws only;
the soft dorsal and anal fins are quite large and
winglike, extending far backward nearly to the
tail; they are quite scaly, which adds much to
their thickness and stiffness; the caudal fin is
broad and nearly square.</p>

<p>The general color is usually gray or slate
color, often bluish with iridescent tints; there are
several dusky, broad vertical bars across the body,
becoming obsolete or faint with age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>It feeds on small marine organisms, and grows
to a length of two feet, occasionally, though its
usual size is ten or twelve inches, and average
weight from one to three or four pounds. It is
an excellent food-fish, though its good qualities in
this respect are not generally known. It spawns
in the spring.</p>

<p>It is usually taken in seines in the bays of the
Gulf coast, and salted with mullet and sheepshead
by the fishermen. It can be caught by the angler
with a very small hook, No. 5 or 6, and cut clam
or conch bait. It is a fair game-fish on light
tackle, which may be the same as advised for the
Bermuda chub.</p>


<h3>THE PIN-FISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Lagodon rhomboides</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Lagodon rhomboides.</i> The Pin-fish. Body elongate, elliptical; head
3-1/5; depth 2-1/2; eye 4; scales 10-65-17; D. XII, 11; A. III, 11;
mouth moderate, maxillary not reaching front of orbit; head
flattened; snout pointed; profile not very steep; 4 incisors in
each jaw, all deeply notched; two series of molars in each jaw;
dorsal fin single, with high spines; caudal fin deeply forked.</p></blockquote>

<p>The pin-fish, also called sailor's choice and
bream in some localities, belongs to the family
<i>Sparidæ</i>, and is closely related to the sheepshead
of that family, having incisor and molar teeth. It
differs from it in the conformation of the skull.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>The pin-fish was first described by Linnæus, in
1766, from specimens sent to him by Dr. Garden
from South Carolina. He named it <i>rhomboides</i>,
meaning "rhomboid," from the shape of its body.
It is abundant on the South Atlantic and Gulf
coasts, extending south to Cuba, and occasionally
north to Cape Cod. It is found in all bays on
the east and west coasts of Florida.</p>

<p>Its body is symmetrical, being rather evenly
curved on both dorsal and ventral lines, and
rather deep; its head is large, with a depression
in front of the eye. Its color is olivaceous, darkest
on the back, with bluish silvery sides, and
narrow horizontal stripes of blue and gold, alternating,
and six faint, broad vertical bars; it has a
dark spot on the shoulder at the top of the gill-cover;
the dorsal fin is bluish with gilt edge; the
anal fin is bluish with yellow band; the caudal
fin is yellow, faintly barred; the ventral fins are
yellowish; the pectoral fins are plain.</p>

<p>It is a pretty fish, and is usually abundant
wherever found. It feeds on small mollusks and
barnacles, resorting to old wharves and about the
mangroves where such food abounds. It grows
to a length of six or eight inches, and though
small, it is a good pan-fish. It spawns in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
spring. The same light tackle used for the pig-fish
and pork-fish can be utilized for the pin-fish,
with small, strong hooks, as Sproat bend, No. 4
or 5, on gut snells. The ends of piers and wharves,
in comparatively shallow water, are favorable
localities for fishing.</p>


<h3>THE SQUIRREL-FISH</h3>

<h4>(<i>Holocentrus ascensionis</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Holocentrus ascensionis.</i> The Squirrel-fish. Body oblong, moderately
compressed, the back a little elevated; head 3-2/3; depth 3-2/5;
eye 3; scales 5-50-7; D. XI, 15; A. IV, 10; head compressed,
narrowed forward; opercle with a strong spine above, below
with the edge sharply serrated; preopercle with a strong spine
at its angle; mouth small, little oblique, with the lower jaw projecting
somewhat; eye excessively large; upper lobe of caudal
fin the longest; soft dorsal fin pointed, as high as the body;
third anal spine very strong, as long as longest anal ray.</p></blockquote>

<p>The squirrel-fish belongs to the family <i>Holocentridæ</i>,
the species comprising that family having
very rough or spinous scales, a single dorsal
fin, deeply divided, with the spines very tall; the
caudal fin deeply forked; the anal fin with four
spines; and a very large eye.</p>

<p>The squirrel-fish belongs to the West Indian
fauna, ranging from the Florida Keys to South
America. It was first described by Osbeck, in
1771, from Ascension Island, who named it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
that locality. It is not uncommon along the
reefs, where I have taken it a number of times.
Its body is oblong, moderately compressed, its
depth about a third of its length, with the back
slightly elevated, and the ventral outline nearly
straight. Its mouth is small, the eye enormously
large, and the caudal fin deeply forked. Its
color is bright crimson, with a darker shade on
the back, and a somewhat lighter tint below, with
silver streaks along the sides. The fins are also
red, some bordered with olive; the head is red
above, with an oblique white bar running back
and down from the eye. It feeds about the reefs
on small fishes and marine invertebrates, and
grows to two feet in length, occasionally, but is
usually found smaller. It is a good food-fish and
sells at sight in the market. It is a remarkably
handsome and attractive fish in appearance.</p>

<p>In one of Stockton's stories, John Gayther, the
gardener, tells of the curious and beautiful things
to be seen on a coral reef in the tropics, with the
aid of a long box with a glass in the end. His
description applies just as well to the vicinity of
the Dry Tortugas, where I have often viewed the
wonders of the sea-floor through a sponge-glass,
a wooden pail with a glass bottom:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where the water is so clear that with a little
help you can see everything just as if it were out
in the open air,&mdash;bushes and vines and hedges;
all sorts of waving plants, all made of seaweed
and coral, growing in the white sand; and instead
of birds flying about among their branches, there
were little fishes of every color: canary-colored
fishes, fishes like robin-redbreasts, and others
which you might have thought were blue jays if
they had been up in the air instead of down in
the water."</p>


<h3>THE TURBOT</h3>

<h4>(<i>Balistes carolinensis</i>)</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Balistes carolinensis.</i> The Turbot. The fishes comprising the
family <i>Balistidæ</i> are characterized by an ovate body, much compressed;
small and low mouth, with separate incisor teeth; eye
very high; gill opening a small slit; the absence of ventral
fins; the dorsal fins widely separated, the first with but 1 to 3
spines. The turbot has a very deep compressed body, covered
with thick, rough plates or scales; head 3-1/4; depth 1-3/4; eye
small; scales about 60; about 35 scales in an oblique series
from vent upward and forward; D. III, 27; A. 25; third dorsal
spine stouter than the second and remote from it; plates on
head similar to those on body; caudal lobes produced; soft
dorsal high; ventral flaps large, supported by several pungent
spines; lateral line very slender, undulating, and very crooked,
showing only when scales are dry; a groove before the eye;
larger plates behind the gill opening.</p></blockquote>

<p>The turbot, or leather-fish, belongs to the
family <i>Balistidæ</i>, or trigger-fishes. It was first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
described by Gmelin, in 1788, from Carolina,
from one of Dr. Garden's specimens, Gmelin
being a coadjutor of Linnæus, to whom the
specimen was sent. The locality from which
the type specimen was sent accounts for its
name.</p>

<p>The turbot, as it is called by the Key West
fishermen, is an inhabitant of tropical waters, and
is abundant on the South Atlantic coast and
along the Florida Keys; it is known also from
the Mediterranean Sea. Like all of the trigger-fishes
it has a curious form and appearance.
It is as deep as long, and slants both ways
from the dorsal fin above and from the ventral
flap below, presenting somewhat of a diamond
shape. The head is triangular, and the
fins are thick and leathery. The first dorsal
spine is locked when erect by the second, or
"trigger." The soft dorsal and anal fins are
opposite each other, and are of similar size and
shape. The color is olive-gray, or slate color,
with some purplish spots on the back; two obscure
cross bars are under the second dorsal fin;
a ring of blue spots alternating with greenish
streaks are about the eye; there are violet marks
on the sides of the snout; the first dorsal is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
spotted and clouded with bluish; the second
dorsal has pale yellowish spots, with rows of blue
ones, separated by greenish reticulations; the
anal fin is colored like the second dorsal; the
pectoral fins are bluish with olive spots.</p>

<p>The leather-fish, or turbot, resorts to rocky
shoals and coral reefs, feeding on the small
marine organisms that are abundant in such
localities. Nothing is known of its breeding
habits. It grows to a foot in length and is considered
a good food-fish by the people of Key
West. The thick skin and rough scales are
pared off together with a sharp knife by the
fishermen when delivered to a customer. It is
caught, with the grunts, porgies, etc., in the
channels among the keys and reefs with the
baited hook, and also in wire traps. Very small
hooks must be used for the turbot, as it has a
very small mouth. Cut crawfish, conch, or barnacles
are good baits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><span class="smcap">Conclusion</span></h2>


<p>In closing this account it occurs to me to say
that the angler who has a genuine love for the
finny tribe, and who has never visited the sunny
waters of Florida, has in store an experience of
joy and delight in the wonderful variety of its
fishes. Some idea may be formed of their number
from the fact that I have collected nearly
three hundred species in the fresh and salt water
of that sub-tropical wonderland. And the fishing
lasts the year round, and is always good, except
when an unusually cold "norther" is blowing.
The warm-water species, like the tarpon, lady-fish,
and ten-pounder, are more plentiful, and extend
their range farther northward in the summer.
At that season all of the inlets and passes of both
the Atlantic and Gulf coasts abound with them;
but the winter visitor will find them in Biscayne
Bay, Barnes Sound, Cards Sound, and southwest
along the keys to the Dry Tortugas. The brackish
water species will be found all winter in the
bays and estuaries of either coast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>A just idea of the fishing resources of Florida
twenty years ago&mdash;and it is much the same today&mdash;may,
perhaps, be gathered from the following
excerpts from my "Camping and Cruising in
Florida":&mdash;</p>

<p>"At flood-tide the channels under the mangroves
teem with redfish, groupers, and snappers,
while near the beds of coon oysters are
schools of sheepshead and drum. In fact, all
of the passes and inlets of the Gulf coast are
fairly alive with fishes, from the mullet to sharks
and sawfish. While lying in his bunk, one can
hear all night long the voices of the deep, under
and around him.</p>

<p>"The hollow, muffled boom of the drumfish
seems to be just under one's pillow; schools of
sparoid fishes feeding on shell-fish at the bottom,
sounds like the snapping of dry twigs on a hot
fire; while a hundred tiny hammers in the hands
of ocean sprites are tapping on the keel. Then
is heard the powerful rush of the tarpon, the
blowing of porpoises, and the snapping jaws of
the sea-trout among the swarms of mullet, which,
leaping from the surface by thousands, awake the
watery echoes like showers of silvery fishes falling
in fitful gusts and squalls.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sanibel Island, at the entrance of Caloosa
Bay and opposite Punta Rassa, is renowned for
its fine fishing. The angler can here fairly revel
in piscatorial abandon and cover himself with
piscine glory and fish scales. If ichthyc variety
is the spice of the angler's life, Sanibel and its
sister keys are the Spice Islands. Sharks, rays,
and devil-fish, tarpon and jewfish, redfish, snappers
and groupers, Spanish mackerel and kingfish,
sea-trout, bonito and cavallies, and <ins class="correction" title="text was 'ladyfish'">lady-fish</ins>
sergeant-fish, sheepshead and drum, a host of
smaller fry&mdash;spots, grunts, and porgies, and the
ever-present and ubiquitous catfish&mdash;can here be
jerked, and yanked and snaked, and pulled and
hauled, until the unfortunate angler will lament
that he was ever born&mdash;under the last but not
least of the zodiacal signs."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The foregoing excerpts relate to fishing on the
Gulf coast, but on the east coast, while the variety
of fishes is not so great, the angler will find
enough and to spare, and many that are worthy
of his best efforts. Large-mouth black-bass are
plentiful in Tomoka River, near Ormond on the
Halifax, and in Elbow Creek, Turkey Creek.
Sebastian River, Taylor's Creek, and the St. Lucie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
River, all tributaries of Indian River. At the
mouths of these streams, brackish-water fishes
will be found in more or less abundance, comprising
most of the species inhabiting the Gulf
coast. Some of the best localities are at Daytona.
New Smyrna, Rock Ledge, Indian River
Inlet, Gilbert's Bar, and Jupiter Inlet. Still farther
south the fishing is much better, notably at
Lake Worth, and on Hillsboro' and New rivers.
Mangrove snappers, bluefish, amber-jacks, and
barracudas are especially abundant south of
Indian River Inlet, more so than on the Gulf
coast. In all of the fresh-water lakes in the
interior of the state the angler will be amply
rewarded, as large-mouth black-bass, calico bass,
warmouth perch, and bream are in most of them.
As a matter of fact, one can hardly go amiss for
some kind of fishing in Florida, wherever there is
water, salt or fresh, provided one proceeds with
patience and intelligence, and with a due regard
for the amenities of the gentle art.</p>

<p>Perhaps the queer descriptions and homely
comparisons of some of the fishes as given by
my negro boatman from the Bahamas, whom
I have before mentioned, may not be uninteresting.
I always employed him when possible, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
he was a good fisherman and sailor, and had
a never-ending fund of anecdotes; and being a
close observer, he had a good general idea of the
fishes of the locality. I always encouraged him
in his quaint and original remarks about fishes,
and in this way obtained considerable knowledge
of their habits from this faithful Achates. Some
of his observations, as I remember them, and
which seem very odd in his Bahamian lingo, were
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Vell, sir, it's curious 'ow some fish is made;
but w'atever their model in length, beam, and draft,
there is some good reason vy they is built so."</p>

<p>"Yes," I would answer, "they are all endowed
by Nature with the shape best fitted for their
mode of life and environment."</p>

<p>"Vell, 'wironment or not, as you say, and
I'm not gainsayin' it, there's as much diff'rence
in their model as atween a man-o'-war 'awk
and an 'ummin'-bird. Now, sir, just look at the
stingaree and the wipporee; they is flat as pancakes,
and goes a-skimmin' along like a turkey
buzzard, or a-wabblin' like a jolly-boat in the
breakers, and then they flops down on a sandbank
like a flounder, when feedin', 'cause their
mouth is hunderneath like a shark. And they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
crawls along on their belly a-gobblin' hup the
periwinkles and fiddlers, and crounches 'em
vith a set of teeth like a pair o' mill-stones."</p>

<p>"Yes," I assented, "the rays are curious
creatures, and have very remarkable teeth."</p>

<p>"Now, on the hother 'and, sir, look at the
moonfish. They is all length and draft and
no beam, like the 'ind weel of a vaggon; it
couldn't cast a shadder if it was facin' the sun.
And the angel-fish 'aven't much more beam to
swear by. Now, sir, hall these slimjims 'ave
small mouths and pinchers for teeth, and goes
a-nosin' 'round the rocks, and a-vorkin' of theirselves
thro' the narrow crannies, and a-pinchin'
hoff the coral-bugs and sea-lice. Now, sir, a
flounder is wicey wersy from a moonfish, it
'asn't hany draft, and don't carry any sail to
speak of, and so it 'ides in the sand a-waitin'
for sumpthin' to turn hup in the vay o' grub."</p>

<p>"That's true," I would say, "they lead a very
lazy, humdrum life, and don't hustle much for
a living."</p>

<p>"But for a real racin' yacht," he would continue,
"give me the kingfish, or Spanish mackerel,
or boneeto; they ketches their food on the run
and jump; and speakin' o' jumpin', sir, look at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
the tarpon, and bone-fish, and skipjack; they is
the kankeroos o' the sea."</p>

<p>"Many fishes," I would observe, "have their
analogues; that is, they seem to bear some
fancied resemblance, either in habits or appearance,
to some object or animal of the land."</p>

<p>"Vell, sir, it's as true as gospel; a man is like
a fish out o' water; 'e puffs like a porpus and
drinks like a fish. And the butterflies are the
yellow grunts and pork-fish and little snappers
and cockeyed pilots; and the red snappers and
squirrel-fish are the fillimingoes and pink curlews;
and the nigger-fish and conies is the le'pards;
and the blowfish and puffers is the 'edge'ogs
and porkupines. And then there's the poll-parrots,
red, blue, yellow, and green, from the puddin'-wife
to slippery-dick; if they'd vings like the
flyin'-fish, we'd put 'em in cages."</p>

<p>"True, enough," I would assent; "and up north
we have fish that go into hiding and sleep all winter,
like the bears; and some that make nests for
their eggs, and guard them, and take care of their
young ones like a hen broods her chicks. And
in some countries there are fish that crawl out
on the land, and climb trees like squirrels."</p>

<p>He listened to this apparently very doubtfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
and frowned fiercely, but kept silent until he filled
and lighted his pipe; then, after scanning the
horizon, he said meekly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think we'll be goin' 'ome, sir; it looks werry
squally in the sou' east."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
